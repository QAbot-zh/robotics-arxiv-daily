This paper explores a new task, where audio signals are used as conditioning inputs to generate motions that align with the semantics of the audio. Unlike text-based interactions, audio provides a more natural and intuitive communication method. However, existing methods typically focus on matching motions with music or speech rhythms, which often results in a weak connection between the semantics of the audio and generated motions. We propose an end-to-end framework using a masked generative transformer, enhanced by a memory-retrieval attention module to handle sparse and lengthy audio inputs. Additionally, we enrich existing datasets by converting descriptions into conversational style and generating corresponding audio with varied speaker identities. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework, demonstrating that audio instructions can convey semantics similar to text while providing more practical and user-friendly interactions.</p></details>|\n", "2505.23457": "|**2025-05-29**|**Long Duration Inspection of GNSS-Denied Environments with a Tethered UAV-UGV Marsupial System**|Sim\u00f3n Mart\u00ednez-Rozas et.al.|[2505.23457](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23457)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become essential tools in inspection and emergency response operations due to their high maneuverability and ability to access hard-to-reach areas. However, their limited battery life significantly restricts their use in long-duration missions. This paper presents a novel tethered marsupial robotic system composed of a UAV and an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV), specifically designed for autonomous, long-duration inspection tasks in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments. The system extends the UAV's operational time by supplying power through a tether connected to high-capacity battery packs carried by the UGV. We detail the hardware architecture based on off-the-shelf components to ensure replicability and describe our full-stack software framework, which is composed of open-source components and built upon the Robot Operating System (ROS). The proposed software architecture enables precise localization using a Direct LiDAR Localization (DLL) method and ensures safe path planning and coordinated trajectory tracking for the integrated UGV-tether-UAV system. We validate the system through three field experiments: (1) a manual flight endurance test to estimate the operational duration, (2) an autonomous navigation test, and (3) an inspection mission to demonstrate autonomous inspection capabilities. Experimental results confirm the robustness and autonomy of the system, its capacity to operate in GNSS-denied environments, and its potential for long-endurance, autonomous inspection and monitoring tasks.</p></details>|\n", "2505.23290": "|**2025-05-29**|**Wav2Sem: Plug-and-Play Audio Semantic Decoupling for 3D Speech-Driven Facial Animation**|Hao Li et.al.|[2505.23290](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23290)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 3D speech-driven facial animation generation, existing methods commonly employ pre-trained self-supervised audio models as encoders. However, due to the prevalence of phonetically similar syllables with distinct lip shapes in language, these near-homophone syllables tend to exhibit significant coupling in self-supervised audio feature spaces, leading to the averaging effect in subsequent lip motion generation. To address this issue, this paper proposes a plug-and-play semantic decorrelation module-Wav2Sem. This module extracts semantic features corresponding to the entire audio sequence, leveraging the added semantic information to decorrelate audio encodings within the feature space, thereby achieving more expressive audio features. Extensive experiments across multiple Speech-driven models indicate that the Wav2Sem module effectively decouples audio features, significantly alleviating the averaging effect of phonetically similar syllables in lip shape generation, thereby enhancing the precision and naturalness of facial animations.

Traditional pathplanning methods, such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), have proven effective but often encounter significant challenges. These include high search space complexity, suboptimal path quality, and slow convergence, issues that are particularly problematic in high-stakes applications like disaster response, where rapid and efficient planning is critical. To address these limitations and enhance path-planning efficiency, we propose Vision Language Model RRT (VLM-RRT), a hybrid approach that integrates the pattern recognition capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the path-planning strengths of RRT. By leveraging VLMs to provide initial directional guidance based on environmental snapshots, our method biases sampling toward regions more likely to contain feasible paths, significantly improving sampling efficiency and path quality. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments with various state-of-the-art VLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed approach.</p></details>|\n", "2505.23197": "|**2025-05-29**|**UPP: Unified Path Planner with Adaptive Safety and Optimality**|Jatin Kumar Arora et.al.|[2505.23197](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23197)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We are surrounded by robots helping us perform complex tasks. Robots have a wide range of applications, from industrial automation to personalized assistance. However, with great technological innovation come significant challenges. One of the major challenges in robotics is path planning. Despite advancements such as graph search, sampling, and potential field methods, most path planning algorithms focus either on optimality or on safety. Very little research addresses both simultaneously. We propose a Unified Path Planner (UPP) that uses modified heuristics and a dynamic safety cost function to balance safety and optimality. The level of safety can be adjusted via tunable parameters, trading off against computational complexity. We demonstrate the planner's performance in simulations, showing how parameter variation affects results. UPP is compared with various traditional and safe-optimal planning algorithms across different scenarios. We also validate it on a TurtleBot, where the robot successfully finds safe and sub-optimal paths.</p></details>|\n", "2505.23189": "|**2025-05-29**|**TrackVLA: Embodied Visual Tracking in the Wild**|Shaoan Wang et.al.|[2505.23189](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23189)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Embodied visual tracking is a fundamental skill in Embodied AI, enabling an agent to follow a specific target in dynamic environments using only egocentric vision. This task is inherently challenging as it requires both accurate target recognition and effective trajectory planning under conditions of severe occlusion and high scene dynamics. Existing approaches typically address this challenge through a modular separation of recognition and planning. In this work, we propose TrackVLA, a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that learns the synergy between object recognition and trajectory planning. Leveraging a shared LLM backbone, we employ a language modeling head for recognition and an anchor-based diffusion model for trajectory planning. To train TrackVLA, we construct an Embodied Visual Tracking Benchmark (EVT-Bench) and collect diverse difficulty levels of recognition samples, resulting in a dataset of 1.7 million samples. Through extensive experiments in both synthetic and real-world environments, TrackVLA demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalizability. It significantly outperforms existing methods on public benchmarks in a zero-shot manner while remaining robust to high dynamics and occlusion in real-world scenarios at 10 FPS inference speed.

Relying solely on audio as the control signal often fails to capture large gesture movements in video, leading to more pronounced artifacts and distortions. Existing approaches typically address this issue by introducing additional a priori information, but this can limit the practical application of the task. Specifically, we propose a Motion Mask-Guided Two-Stage Network (MMGT) that uses audio, as well as motion masks and motion features generated from the audio signal to jointly drive the generation of synchronized speech gesture videos. In the first stage, the Spatial Mask-Guided Audio Pose Generation (SMGA) Network generates high-quality pose videos and motion masks from audio, effectively capturing large movements in key regions such as the face and gestures. In the second stage, we integrate the Motion Masked Hierarchical Audio Attention (MM-HAA) into the Stabilized Diffusion Video Generation model, overcoming limitations in fine-grained motion generation and region-specific detail control found in traditional methods. This guarantees high-quality, detailed upper-body video generation with accurate texture and motion details. Evaluations show improved video quality, lip-sync, and gesture. The model and code are available at https://github.com/SIA-IDE/MMGT.</p></details>|\n", "2505.23111": "|**2025-05-29**|**Redundancy Parameterization of the ABB YuMi Robot Arm**|Alexander J. Elias et.al.|[2505.23111](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23111)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The ABB YuMi is a 7-DOF collaborative robot arm with a complex, redundant kinematic structure. Path planning for the YuMi is challenging, especially with joint limits considered. The redundant degree of freedom is parameterized by the Shoulder-Elbow-Wrist (SEW) angle, called the arm angle by ABB, but the exact definition must be known for path planning outside the RobotStudio simulator. We provide the first complete and validated definition of the SEW angle used for the YuMi. It follows the conventional SEW angle formulation with the shoulder-elbow direction chosen to be the direction of the fourth joint axis. Our definition also specifies the shoulder location, making it compatible with any choice of reference vector. A previous attempt to define the SEW angle exists in the literature, but it is incomplete and deviates from the behavior observed in RobotStudio. Because our formulation fits within the general SEW angle framework, we also obtain the expression for the SEW angle Jacobian and complete numerical conditions for all algorithmic singularities. Finally, we demonstrate using IK-Geo, our inverse kinematics (IK) solver based on subproblem decomposition, to find all IK solutions using 2D search. Code examples are available in a publicly accessible repository.</p></details>|\n", "2505.22974": "|**2025-05-29**|**Learning coordinated badminton skills for legged manipulators**|Yuntao Ma et.al.|[2505.22974](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22974)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Coordinating the motion between lower and upper limbs and aligning limb control with perception are substantial challenges in robotics, particularly in dynamic environments. To this end, we introduce an approach for enabling legged mobile manipulators to play badminton, a task that requires precise coordination of perception, locomotion, and arm swinging. We propose a unified reinforcement learning-based control policy for whole-body visuomotor skills involving all degrees of freedom to achieve effective shuttlecock tracking and striking. This policy is informed by a perception noise model that utilizes real-world camera data, allowing for consistent perception error levels between simulation and deployment and encouraging learned active perception behaviors. Our method includes a shuttlecock prediction model, constrained reinforcement learning for robust motion control, and integrated system identification techniques to enhance deployment readiness. Extensive experimental results in a variety of environments validate the robot's capability to predict shuttlecock trajectories, navigate the service area effectively, and execute precise strikes against human players, demonstrating the feasibility of using legged mobile manipulators in complex and dynamic sports scenarios.</p></details>|\n", "2505.22944": "|**2025-05-28**|**ATI: Any Trajectory Instruction for Controllable Video Generation**|Angtian Wang et.al.|[2505.22944](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22944)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose a unified framework for motion control in video generation that seamlessly integrates camera movement, object-level translation, and fine-grained local motion using trajectory-based inputs. In contrast to prior methods that address these motion types through separate modules or task-specific designs, our approach offers a cohesive solution by projecting user-defined trajectories into the latent space of pre-trained image-to-video generation models via a lightweight motion injector. Users can specify keypoints and their motion paths to control localized deformations, entire object motion, virtual camera dynamics, or combinations of these. The injected trajectory signals guide the generative process to produce temporally consistent and semantically aligned motion sequences. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple video motion control tasks, including stylized motion effects (e.g., motion brushes), dynamic viewpoint changes, and precise local motion manipulation. Experiments show that our method provides significantly better controllability and visual quality compared to prior approaches and commercial solutions, while remaining broadly compatible with various state-of-the-art video generation backbones.

However, existing approaches usually adopt an offline learning framework, which faces two core limitations: (1) heavy reliance on high-quality manual annotations for element grounding and action supervision, and (2) limited adaptability to dynamic and interactive environments. To address these limitations, we propose ZeroGUI, a scalable, online learning framework for automating GUI Agent training at Zero human cost. Specifically, ZeroGUI integrates (i) VLM-based automatic task generation to produce diverse training goals from the current environment state, (ii) VLM-based automatic reward estimation to assess task success without hand-crafted evaluation functions, and (iii) two-stage online reinforcement learning to continuously interact with and learn from GUI environments. Experiments on two advanced GUI Agents (UI-TARS and Aguvis) demonstrate that ZeroGUI significantly boosts performance across OSWorld and AndroidLab environments.

However, they exhibit limited generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios without an explicit reasoning process. Although recent efforts leverage reinforcement learning through group-relative policy optimization (GRPO) to enhance reasoning ability, they often suffer from overthinking - producing uniformly verbose reasoning chains irrespective of task complexity. This results in elevated computational costs and limited control over reasoning quality. To address this problem, we propose PixelThink, a simple yet effective scheme that integrates externally estimated task difficulty and internally measured model uncertainty to regulate reasoning generation within a reinforcement learning paradigm. The model learns to compress reasoning length in accordance with scene complexity and predictive confidence. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce ReasonSeg-Diff, an extended benchmark with annotated reasoning references and difficulty scores, along with a suite of metrics designed to assess segmentation accuracy, reasoning quality, and efficiency jointly. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach improves both reasoning efficiency and overall segmentation performance. Our work contributes novel perspectives towards efficient and interpretable multimodal understanding.

However, most existing approaches rely heavily on manual prompt engineering, failing to adapt and optimize based on diverse experimental experiences. Focusing on this, for the first time, we explore the paradigm of learning-based agentic ML, where an LLM agent learns through interactive experimentation on ML tasks using online reinforcement learning (RL). To realize this, we propose a novel agentic ML training framework with three key components: (1) exploration-enriched fine-tuning, which enables LLM agents to generate diverse actions for enhanced RL exploration; (2) step-wise RL, which enables training on a single action step, accelerating experience collection and improving training efficiency; (3) an agentic ML-specific reward module, which unifies varied ML feedback signals into consistent rewards for RL optimization. Leveraging this framework, we train ML-Agent, driven by a 7B-sized Qwen-2.5 LLM for autonomous ML. Remarkably, despite being trained on merely 9 ML tasks, our 7B-sized ML-Agent outperforms the 671B-sized DeepSeek-R1 agent.

However, methods typically rely on a weighted sum of conflicting reward functions, requiring extensive tuning to achieve a desired behavior. Due to the computational cost of RL, this iterative process is a tedious, time-intensive task. Furthermore, for robotics applications, the weights need to be chosen such that the policy performs well in the real world, despite inevitable sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework that trains a single policy conditioned on a set of weights, spanning the Pareto front of reward trade-offs. Within this framework, weights can be selected and tuned after training, significantly speeding up iteration time. We demonstrate how this improved workflow can be used to perform highly dynamic motions with a robot character. Moreover, we explore how weight-conditioned policies can be leveraged in hierarchical settings, using a high-level policy to dynamically select weights according to the current task. We show that the multi-objective policy encodes a diverse spectrum of behaviors, facilitating efficient adaptation to novel tasks.</p></details>|\n", "2505.23703": "|**2025-05-29**|**Let's Reason Formally: Natural-Formal Hybrid Reasoning Enhances LLM's Math Capability**|Ruida Wang et.al.|[2505.23703](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23703)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs has garnered significant attention in both the mathematical and computer science communities. Recent works have made substantial progress in both Natural Language (NL) reasoning and Formal Language (FL) reasoning by leveraging the potential of pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods on base models. However, RL approaches struggle to impart new capabilities not presented in the base model, highlighting the need to integrate more knowledge like FL into NL math reasoning effectively. Yet, this integration is challenging due to inherent disparities in problem structure and reasoning format between NL and FL. To address these challenges, we introduce **NL-FL HybridReasoning**, an end-to-end framework designed to incorporate the FL expert into NL math problem-solving. To bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the *NL-FL Problem Alignment* method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA) problems in NL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the *Mixed Problem Input* technique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and existence problems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output format gap in reasoning through an LLM-based *Answer Extraction* mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the **HybridReasoning** framework achieves **89.80%** and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC benchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by 4.60% and 4.82%, respectively.

However, most of these policies are trained on data collected from limited robot positions and camera viewpoints. This leads to poor generalization to novel robot positions, which limits the use of these policies on mobile platforms, especially for precise tasks like pressing buttons or turning faucets. In this work, we formulate the policy mobilization problem: find a mobile robot base pose in a novel environment that is in distribution with respect to a manipulation policy trained on a limited set of camera viewpoints. Compared to retraining the policy itself to be more robust to unseen robot base pose initializations, policy mobilization decouples navigation from manipulation and thus does not require additional demonstrations. Crucially, this problem formulation complements existing efforts to improve manipulation policy robustness to novel viewpoints and remains compatible with them. To study policy mobilization, we introduce the Mobi-$\\pi$ framework, which includes: (1) metrics that quantify the difficulty of mobilizing a given policy, (2) a suite of simulated mobile manipulation tasks based on RoboCasa to evaluate policy mobilization, (3) visualization tools for analysis, and (4) several baseline methods. We also propose a novel approach that bridges navigation and manipulation by optimizing the robot's base pose to align with an in-distribution base pose for a learned policy. Our approach utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting for novel view synthesis, a score function to evaluate pose suitability, and sampling-based optimization to identify optimal robot poses. We show that our approach outperforms baselines in both simulation and real-world environments, demonstrating its effectiveness for policy mobilization.</p></details>|\n", "2505.23678": "|**2025-05-29**|**Grounded Reinforcement Learning for Visual Reasoning**|Gabriel Sarch et.al.|[2505.23678](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23678)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>While reinforcement learning (RL) over chains of thought has significantly advanced language models in tasks such as mathematics and coding, visual reasoning introduces added complexity by requiring models to direct visual attention, interpret perceptual inputs, and ground abstract reasoning in spatial evidence. We introduce ViGoRL (Visually Grounded Reinforcement Learning), a vision-language model trained with RL to explicitly anchor each reasoning step to specific visual coordinates. Inspired by human visual decision-making, ViGoRL learns to produce spatially grounded reasoning traces, guiding visual attention to task-relevant regions at each step. When fine-grained exploration is required, our novel multi-turn RL framework enables the model to dynamically zoom into predicted coordinates as reasoning unfolds. Across a diverse set of visual reasoning benchmarks--including SAT-2 and BLINK for spatial reasoning, V*bench for visual search, and ScreenSpot and VisualWebArena for web-based grounding--ViGoRL consistently outperforms both supervised fine-tuning and conventional RL baselines that lack explicit grounding mechanisms. Incorporating multi-turn RL with zoomed-in visual feedback significantly improves ViGoRL's performance on localizing small GUI elements and visual search, achieving 86.4% on V*Bench. Additionally, we find that grounding amplifies other visual behaviors such as region exploration, grounded subgoal setting, and visual verification. Finally, human evaluations show that the model's visual references are not only spatially accurate but also helpful for understanding model reasoning steps.

In this paper, we propose Formula Tuning (Fortune), a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that trains LMs to generate executable spreadsheet formulas for question answering over general tabular data. Formula Tuning reduces the reliance on supervised formula annotations by using binary answer correctness as a reward signal, guiding the model to learn formula derivation through reasoning. We provide a theoretical analysis of its advantages and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on seven table reasoning benchmarks. Formula Tuning substantially enhances LM performance, particularly on multi-step numerical and symbolic reasoning tasks, enabling a 7B model to outperform O1 on table understanding.

Starting from a coarse mesh, AMBER iteratively predicts the sizing field, i.e., a function mapping from the geometry to the local element size of the target mesh, and uses this prediction to produce a new intermediate mesh using an out-of-the-box mesh generator. This process is enabled through a hierarchical graph neural network, and relies on data augmentation by automatically projecting expert labels onto AMBER-generated data during training. We evaluate AMBER on 2D and 3D datasets, including classical physics problems, mechanical components, and real-world industrial designs with human expert meshes.

However, the constraints of real-time control are often at odds with the design of VLMs: the most powerful VLMs have tens or hundreds of billions of parameters, presenting an obstacle to real-time inference, and operate on discrete tokens rather than the continuous-valued outputs that are required for controlling robots. To address this challenge, recent VLA models have used specialized modules for efficient continuous control, such as action experts or continuous output heads, which typically require adding new untrained parameters to the pretrained VLM backbone. While these modules improve real-time and control capabilities, it remains an open question whether they preserve or degrade the semantic knowledge contained in the pretrained VLM, and what effect they have on the VLA training dynamics. In this paper, we study this question in the context of VLAs that include a continuous diffusion or flow matching action expert, showing that naively including such experts significantly harms both training speed and knowledge transfer. We provide an extensive analysis of various design choices, their impact on performance and knowledge transfer, and propose a technique for insulating the VLM backbone during VLA training that mitigates this issue.

This task is inherently challenging as it requires both accurate target recognition and effective trajectory planning under conditions of severe occlusion and high scene dynamics. Existing approaches typically address this challenge through a modular separation of recognition and planning. In this work, we propose TrackVLA, a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that learns the synergy between object recognition and trajectory planning. Leveraging a shared LLM backbone, we employ a language modeling head for recognition and an anchor-based diffusion model for trajectory planning. To train TrackVLA, we construct an Embodied Visual Tracking Benchmark (EVT-Bench) and collect diverse difficulty levels of recognition samples, resulting in a dataset of 1.7 million samples. Through extensive experiments in both synthetic and real-world environments, TrackVLA demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalizability. It significantly outperforms existing methods on public benchmarks in a zero-shot manner while remaining robust to high dynamics and occlusion in real-world scenarios at 10 FPS inference speed.

Consequently, studying the UV emission and the cold gas of late-type galaxies provide key insights in the evolution of short-lived starburst and galaxy quenching. In this work, we conduted a study of two 28' fields observed with UVIT-AstroSat in the central region of the Abell cluster A496 ($z=0.033$), including HI, data from NRAO VLA. We reported 22 cluster members detected in FUV; all of them are detected in HI, or have upper limits for the HI-mass. We find our FUV detected galaxies generally have higher specific star formation rates than other star forming galaxies. Most of the FUV galaxies with masses above 10$^9 \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$,and showing high sSFR have no close neighbors, pointing at RPS as the dominant mechanism affecting them. In contrast, most of the low-mass FUV objects present at least one companion, suggesting that tidal interactions also play an important role in the triggering of infalling galaxies. Combining the FUV-SFR with the HI properties of the observed galaxies in A496 we identify an evolutionary sequence consisting of five stages: (1) Pre-triggering, (2) Initial SF-triggering, (3) Peak of star-formation, (4) SF-fading, and (5) SF-quenching. During this path, normal gas-rich objects reach a gas-deficiency phase with SFR well below the main sequence. This process, prior to becoming a full passive galaxy, can be accomplished within a few 10$^{8}$ yr.</p></details>|\n", "2505.21929": "|**2025-05-28**|**MWA and VLA Observations of Diffuse Radio Lobes in M 87**|Linhui Wu et.al.|[2505.21929](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21929)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This study investigates the projected, quasi-symmetric $\\sim\\rm46\\,kpc$-scale diffuse radio lobes surrounding the giant elliptical galaxy M\\,87, utilizing well-sampled wideband ($\\rm 60\\,MHz-10.55\\,GHz$) observations from MWA and VLA, supplemented by data from LOFAR and Effelsberg.

However, despite leveraging powerful pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), existing end-to-end VLA systems often lose key capabilities during fine-tuning as the model adapts to specific robotic tasks. We argue that a generalizable VLA model should retain and expand upon the VLM's core competencies: 1) Open-world embodied reasoning - the VLA should inherit the knowledge from VLM, i.e., recognize anything that the VLM can recognize, capable of solving math problems, possessing visual-spatial intelligence, 2) Reasoning following - effectively translating the open-world reasoning into actionable steps for the robot. In this work, we introduce ChatVLA-2, a novel mixture-of-expert VLA model coupled with a specialized three-stage training pipeline designed to preserve the VLM's original strengths while enabling actionable reasoning. To validate our approach, we design a math-matching task wherein a robot interprets math problems written on a whiteboard and picks corresponding number cards from a table to solve equations. Remarkably, our method exhibits exceptional mathematical reasoning and OCR capabilities, despite these abilities not being explicitly trained within the VLA. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the VLA possesses strong spatial reasoning skills, enabling it to interpret novel directional instructions involving previously unseen objects. Overall, our method showcases reasoning and comprehension abilities that significantly surpass state-of-the-art imitation learning methods such as OpenVLA, DexVLA, and pi-zero.

While prior work has primarily focused on architectural optimization, we take a different perspective by identifying a dual form of redundancy in VLA models: (i) high similarity across consecutive action steps, and (ii) substantial redundancy in visual tokens. Motivated by these observations, we propose FlashVLA, the first training-free and plug-and-play acceleration framework that enables action reuse in VLA models. FlashVLA improves inference efficiency through a token-aware action reuse mechanism that avoids redundant decoding across stable action steps, and an information-guided visual token selection strategy that prunes low-contribution tokens. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark show that FlashVLA reduces FLOPs by 55.7% and latency by 36.0%, with only a 0.7% drop in task success rate.

Using Abaqus, the air puff test is applied to eyes with varying biomechanical parameters, such as material properties, corneal thickness, and radius. A reduced order model of the air puff (a turbulent impinging jet) has been acquired to decrease simulation time from 48 hours for the FSI model to approximately 12 minutes for the finite element analysis (FEA) model alone. To further accelerate simulations and improve model accuracy, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) will be integrated with the reduced-order model. This hybrid approach will help expand the model to a larger dataset, enhancing intraocular pressure (IOP) estimation accuracy and the corneal material properties algorithm through inverse FEA. Additionally, a neural network (NN) framework with embedded Gaussian-modulated waveforms is proposed to model the pressure and deformation distributions on the corneal surface as functions of spatial and temporal parameters. By learning the relationship between corneal biomechanical inputs such as Corneal Central Thickness (CCT), Intraocular Pressure (IOP), and baseline properties (Mu), and the governing coefficients of pressure and deformation, the network accurately reconstructs the result that matches well with the high-fidelity CFD data. This approach can quickly capture the distribution of pressure and deformation. It can also provide insights into the distinct spatial and temporal dynamics of pressure and deformation, giving a more comprehensive understanding of fluid-structure interaction phenomena in the air puff test.</p></details>|\n", "2505.22377": "|**2025-05-28**|**Multiprecision computing for multistage fractional physics-informed neural networks**|Na Xue et.al.|[2505.22377](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22377)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fractional physics-informed neural networks (fPINNs) have been successfully introduced in [Pang, Lu and Karniadakis, SIAM J.

In particular, since PINNs are generally able to solve a class of partial differential equations (PDEs), they can be employed to learn the value function of the infinite-horizon optimal control problem via solving the associated steady-state Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. However, an issue here is that the steady-state HJB equation generally yields multiple solutions; hence if PINNs are directly employed to it, they may end up approximating a solution that is different from the optimal value function of the problem. We tackle this by instead applying PINNs to a finite-horizon variant of the steady-state HJB that has a unique solution, and which uniformly approximates the optimal value function as the horizon increases. An algorithm to verify if the chosen horizon is large enough is also given, as well as a method to extend it -- with reduced computations and robustness to approximation errors -- in case it is not. Unlike many existing methods, the proposed technique works well with non-polynomial basis functions, does not require prior knowledge of a stabilizing controller, and does not perform iterative policy evaluations. Simulations are performed, which verify and clarify theoretical findings.</p></details>|\n", "2505.21723": "|**2025-05-27**|**Are Statistical Methods Obsolete in the Era of Deep Learning?**|Skyler Wu et.al.|[2505.21723](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21723)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the era of AI, neural networks have become increasingly popular for modeling, inference, and prediction, largely due to their potential for universal approximation. With the proliferation of such deep learning models, a question arises: are leaner statistical methods still relevant? To shed insight on this question, we employ the mechanistic nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) inverse problem as a testbed, using physics-informed neural network (PINN) as a representative of the deep learning paradigm and manifold-constrained Gaussian process inference (MAGI) as a representative of statistically principled methods. Through case studies involving the SEIR model from epidemiology and the Lorenz model from chaotic dynamics, we demonstrate that statistical methods are far from obsolete, especially when working with sparse and noisy observations. On tasks such as parameter inference and trajectory reconstruction, statistically principled methods consistently achieve lower bias and variance, while using far fewer parameters and requiring less hyperparameter tuning. Statistical methods can also decisively outperform deep learning models on out-of-sample future prediction, where the absence of relevant data often leads overparameterized models astray. Additionally, we find that statistically principled approaches are more robust to accumulation of numerical imprecision and can represent the underlying system more faithful to the true governing ODEs.</p></details>|\n", "2505.21404": "|**2025-05-27**|**Dual Natural Gradient Descent for Scalable Training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks**|Anas Jnini et.al.|[2505.21404](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21404)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Natural-gradient methods markedly accelerate the training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), yet their Gauss--Newton update must be solved in the parameter space, incurring a prohibitive $O(n^3)$ time complexity, where $n$ is the number of network trainable weights.
