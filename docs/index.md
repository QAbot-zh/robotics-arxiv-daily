Alghamdi et.al.|[2504.20947](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20947)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose an opinion-driven navigation framework for multi-robot traversal through a narrow corridor. Our approach leverages a multi-agent decision-making model known as the Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics (NOD) to address the narrow corridor passage problem, formulated as a multi-robot navigation game. By integrating the NOD model with a multi-robot path planning algorithm, we demonstrate that the framework effectively reduces the likelihood of deadlocks during corridor traversal. To ensure scalability with an increasing number of robots, we introduce a game reduction technique that enables efficient coordination in larger groups. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details>|

To address these, we developed an interactive control strategy that assists the human operator by predicting their motion plan at both high and low levels. At the high level, a surgeme recognition system is employed through a Transformer-based real-time gesture classification model to dynamically adapt to the operator's actions, while at the low level, a Confidence-based Intention Assimilation Controller adjusts robot actions based on user intent and shared control paradigms. The system is built around a robotic suturing task, supported by sensors that capture the kinematics of the robot and task dynamics. Experiments across users with varying skill levels demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing statistically significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional teleoperation.</p></details>|

By leveraging the inherent parallelism of quantum computing, the proposed approach generates robust Q tables and specialized turn cost estimations, which are then integrated with a classical Reinforcement Learning pipeline. The Classical Quantum fusion results in rapid convergence of training, reducing the training time significantly and improved adaptability in scenarios featuring static, dynamic, and moving obstacles. Simulator based evaluations demonstrate significant enhancements in path efficiency, trajectory smoothness, and mission success rates, underscoring the potential of framework for real time, autonomous navigation in complex and unpredictable environments. Furthermore, the proposed framework was tested beyond simulations on practical scenarios, including real world map data such as the IIT Delhi campus, reinforcing its potential for real time, autonomous navigation in complex and unpredictable environments.</p></details>|
|**2025-04-28**|**Clustering-based Recurrent Neural Network Controller synthesis under Signal Temporal Logic Specifications**|Kazunobu Serizawa et.al.|[2504.19846](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19846)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Autonomous robotic systems require advanced control frameworks to achieve complex temporal objectives that extend beyond conventional stability and trajectory tracking. Signal Temporal Logic (STL) provides a formal framework for specifying such objectives, with robustness metrics widely employed for control synthesis. Existing optimization-based approaches using neural network (NN)-based controllers often rely on a single NN for both learning and control. However, variations in initial states and obstacle configurations can lead to discontinuous changes in the optimization solution, thereby degrading generalization and control performance. To address this issue, this study proposes a method to enhance recurrent neural network (RNN)-based control by clustering solution trajectories that satisfy STL specifications under diverse initial conditions. The proposed approach utilizes trajectory similarity metrics to generate clustering labels, which are subsequently used to train a classification network. This network assigns new initial states and obstacle configurations to the appropriate cluster, enabling the selection of a specialized controller. By explicitly accounting for variations in solution trajectories, the proposed method improves both estimation accuracy and control performance. Numerical experiments on a dynamic vehicle path planning problem demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.</p></details>|

While the diffusion model allows for high-quality motion generation, its computational cost is too expensive to control a robot in real time. To achieve high quality and efficiency simultaneously, our one-step diffusion model takes an approximately generated motion, which is predicted directly from input images. This approximate motion is optimized by additive noise provided by our novel noise optimizer. Unlike general isotropic noise, our noise optimizer adjusts noise anisotropically depending on the uncertainty of each motion element. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining its efficiency by one-step diffusion.</p></details>|
|**2025-04-28**|**A Time-dependent Risk-aware distributed Multi-Agent Path Finder based on A***|S Nordstr√∂m et.al.|[2504.19593](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19593)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Multi-Agent Path-Finding (MAPF) focuses on the collaborative planning of paths for multiple agents within shared spaces, aiming for collision-free navigation. Conventional planning methods often overlook the presence of other agents, which can result in conflicts. In response, this article introduces the A $^*_+$T algorithm, a distributed approach that improves coordination among agents by anticipating their positions based on their movement speeds. The algorithm also considers dynamic obstacles, assessing potential collisions with respect to observed speeds and trajectories, thereby facilitating collision-free path planning in environments populated by other agents and moving objects. It incorporates a risk layer surrounding both dynamic and static entities, enhancing its utility in real-world applications. Each agent functions autonomously while being mindful of the paths chosen by others, effectively addressing the complexities inherent in multi-agent situations. The performance of A$^*_+$ T has been rigorously tested in the Gazebo simulation environment and benchmarked against established approaches such as CBS, ECBS, and SIPP. Furthermore, the algorithm has shown competence in single-agent experiments, with results demonstrating its effectiveness in managing dynamic obstacles and affirming its practical relevance across various scenarios.</p></details>|

Traditional modular methods suffer from error propagation, while existing end-to-end models typically employ static one-shot inference paradigms that inadequately capture the dynamic changes of the environment. ARTEMIS takes a different method by generating trajectory waypoints sequentially, preserves critical temporal dependencies while dynamically routing scene-specific queries to specialized expert networks. It effectively relieves trajectory quality degradation issues encountered when guidance information is ambiguous, and overcomes the inherent representational limitations of singular network architectures when processing diverse driving scenarios. Additionally, we use a lightweight batch reallocation strategy that significantly improves the training speed of the Mixture-of-Experts model. Through experiments on the NAVSIM dataset, ARTEMIS exhibits superior competitive performance, achieving 87.0 PDMS and 83.1 EPDMS with ResNet-34 backbone, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics.</p></details>|
|**2025-04-28**|**Using the Translation Theorem for the Automated Stationkeeping of Extremely-Low Lunar Missions**|Jack Yarndley et.al.|[2504.19559](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19559)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Extremely-Low Lunar Orbits (eLLOs) (altitudes $\leq 50$ km) exhibit severe perturbations due to the highly non-spherical lunar gravitational field, presenting unique challenges to orbit maintenance. These altitudes are too low for the existence of stable `frozen' orbits, and naive stationkeeping methods, such as circularization, perform poorly. However, mission designers have noticed a particular characteristic of low lunar orbits, which they have found useful for stationkeeping and dubbed the "translation theorem", wherein the eccentricity vector follows a predictable monthly pattern that is independent of its starting value. We demonstrate this feature results from the low orbital eccentricity combined with the dominant effect of a particular subset of sectoral and tesseral harmonics. Subsequently, automated stationkeeping strategies for eLLOs are presented, utilizing this theorem for eccentricity vector control. Several constraints within the eccentricity vector plane are explored, including circular, annular, and elevation-model derived regions, each forming distinct stationkeeping strategies for varying orbital configurations. Subsequently, the optimal control profiles for these maneuvers within the eccentricity plane are obtained using Sequential Convex Programming (SCP). The proposed strategies offer computational simplicity and clear advantages when compared to traditional methods and are comparable to full trajectory optimization.</p></details>|

Force control is important for handling delicate objects such as food. In addition, achieving complex movements is possible by making robot motions based on human teachings. Four-channel bilateral control is proposed, which enables the simultaneous teaching of position and force information. Moreover, methods have been developed to reproduce motions obtained through human teachings and generate adaptive motions using learning. We demonstrated the effectiveness of these methods for food handling tasks in the Food Topping Challenge at the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2024). For the task of serving salmon roe on rice, we achieved the best performance because of the high reproducibility and quick motion of the proposed method. Further, for the task of picking fried chicken, we successfully picked the most pieces of fried chicken among all participating teams. This paper describes the implementation and performance of these methods.</p></details>|

To tackle this, an end-to-end foot trajectory and force optimization framework (FTFOF) is proposed, which optimizes foot adhesion and detachment forces through trajectory adjustments. This framework accepts general foot trajectory constraints and user-defined parameters as input, ultimately producing an optimal single foot trajectory. It integrates three-segment $C^2$ continuous Bezier curves, tailored to various foot structures, enabling the generation of effective climbing trajectories. A dilate-based GRU predictive model establishes the relationship between foot trajectories and the corresponding foot forces. Multi-objective optimization algorithms, combined with a redundancy hierarchical strategy, identify the most suitable foot trajectory for specific tasks, thereby ensuring optimal performance across detachment force, adhesion force and vibration amplitude. Experimental validation on the quadruped climbing robot MST-M3F showed that, compared to commonly used trajectories in existing legged climbing robots, the proposed framework achieved reductions in maximum detachment force by 28 \%, vibration amplitude by 82 \%, which ensures the stable climbing of dry adhesion legged climbing robots.</p></details>|

While autonomous decision-making agents powered by modern LLMs could facilitate numerous real-world applications, such successes demand agents that are capable of data-efficient RL. One key obstacle to achieving data efficiency in RL is exploration, a challenge that we demonstrate many recent proposals for LLM agent designs struggle to contend with. Meanwhile, classic algorithms from the RL literature known to gracefully address exploration require technical machinery that can be challenging to operationalize in purely natural language settings. In this work, rather than relying on finetuning or in-context learning to coax LLMs into implicitly imitating a RL algorithm, we illustrate how LLMs can be used to explicitly implement an existing RL algorithm (Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning) whose capacity for statistically-efficient exploration is already well-studied. We offer empirical results demonstrating how our LLM-based implementation of a known, data-efficient RL algorithm can be considerably more effective in natural language tasks that demand prudent exploration.</p></details>|

In this work, we introduce XPG-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to efficiently perform MS tasks through explainable, priority-guided decision-making based on raw sensory inputs. XPG-RL integrates a task-driven action prioritization mechanism with a learned context-aware switching strategy that dynamically selects from a discrete set of action primitives such as target grasping, occlusion removal, and viewpoint adjustment. Within this strategy, a policy is optimized to output adaptive threshold values that govern the discrete selection among action primitives. The perception module fuses RGB-D inputs with semantic and geometric features to produce a structured scene representation for downstream decision-making. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that XPG-RL consistently outperforms baseline methods in task success rates and motion efficiency, achieving up to 4.5 $\times$ higher efficiency in long-horizon tasks. These results underscore the benefits of integrating domain knowledge with learnable decision-making policies for robust and efficient robotic manipulation.</p></details>|
|**2025-04-29**|**Improvements of Dark Experience Replay and Reservoir Sampling towards Better Balance between Consolidation and Plasticity**|Taisuke Kobayashi et.al.|[2504.20932](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20932)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Continual learning is the one of the most essential abilities for autonomous agents, which can incrementally learn daily-life skills. For this ultimate goal, a simple but powerful method, dark experience replay (DER), has been proposed recently. DER mitigates catastrophic forgetting, in which the skills acquired in the past are unintentionally forgotten, by stochastically storing the streaming data in a reservoir sampling (RS) buffer and by relearning them or retaining the past outputs for them. However, since DER considers multiple objectives, it will not function properly without appropriate weighting of them. In addition, the ability to retain past outputs inhibits learning if the past outputs are incorrect due to distribution shift or other effects. This is due to a tradeoff between memory consolidation and plasticity. The tradeoff is hidden even in the RS buffer, which gradually stops storing new data for new skills in it as data is continuously passed to it. To alleviate the tradeoff and achieve better balance, this paper proposes improvement strategies to each of DER and RS. Specifically, DER is improved with automatic adaptation of weights, block of replaying erroneous data, and correction of past outputs. RS is also improved with generalization of acceptance probability, stratification of plural buffers, and intentional omission of unnecessary data. These improvements are verified through multiple benchmarks including regression, classification, and reinforcement learning problems. As a result, the proposed methods achieve steady improvements in learning performance by balancing the memory consolidation and plasticity.</p></details>|

Existing literature has proposed inexact decompositions of local Q-functions based on empirical information structures between the agents. In this paper, we exploit inter-agent coupling information and propose a systematic approach to exactly decompose the local Q-function of each agent. We develop an approximate least square policy iteration algorithm based on the proposed decomposition and identify two architectures to learn the local Q-function for each agent. We establish that the worst-case sample complexity of the decomposition is equal to the centralized case and derive necessary and sufficient graphical conditions on the inter-agent couplings to achieve better sample efficiency. We demonstrate the improved sample efficiency and computational efficiency on numerical examples.</p></details>|

Current approaches to AI safety typically address predefined domain-specific safety conditions, limiting their ability to generalize across contexts.   We propose a novel AI safety framework that ensures AI systems comply with \textbf{any user-defined constraint}, with \textbf{any desired probability}, and across \textbf{various domains}.   In this framework, we combine an AI component (e.g., neural network) with an optimization problem to produce responses that minimize objectives while satisfying user-defined constraints with probabilities exceeding user-defined thresholds. For credibility assessment of the AI component, we propose \textit{internal test data}, a supplementary set of safety-labeled data, and a \textit{conservative testing} methodology that provides statistical validity of using internal test data. We also present an approximation method of a loss function and how to compute its gradient for training.   We mathematically prove that probabilistic constraint satisfaction is guaranteed under specific, mild conditions and prove a scaling law between safety and the number of internal test data. We demonstrate our framework's effectiveness through experiments in diverse domains: demand prediction for production decision, safe reinforcement learning within the SafetyGym simulator, and guarding AI chatbot outputs. Through these experiments, we demonstrate that our method guarantees safety for user-specified constraints, outperforms {for \textbf{up to several order of magnitudes}} existing methods in low safety threshold regions, and scales effectively with respect to the size of internal test data.</p></details>|

Our focus is on critic-free methods compatible with LoRA fine-tuning on a single 40GB GPU, a common limitation in academic settings. We introduce S-GRPO, a memory-efficient variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization, and T-SPMO, a token-level prefix matching strategy for fine-grained credit assignment. Despite limited resources, when used to fine-tune Qwen2-1.5B both methods significantly improve SVAMP benchmark accuracy from 46% to above 70% using LoRA training. T-SPMO also excels in multi-digit multiplication tasks, underscoring the potential of RL fine-tuning under hardware constraints. Additionally, we find that our full-token GRPO baseline under LoRA fine-tuning did not improve model performance (compared to base model) on either task, suggesting that our memory-efficient methods may act as a form of regularization that stabilizes training when only a small subset of parameters are updated.</p></details>|

However, highly fluctuating temperature in winter season results in poor greenhouse temperature control, which affects crop growth and increases energy consumption. To tackle these challenges, an advanced control system that can efficiently optimize multiple objectives under dramatic climate conditions is essential. Therefore, this study propose a model predictive control-coupled proximal policy optimization (MPC-PPO) control framework. A teacher-student control framework is constructed in which the MPC generating high-quality control experiences to guide the PPO agent's learning process. An adaptive dynamic weighting mechanism is employed to balance the influence of MPC experiences during PPO training. Evaluation conducted in solar greenhouses across three provinces in northern China (Beijing, Hebei, and Shandong) demonstrates that: (1) the MPC-PPO method achieved the highest temperature control performance (96.31 on a 100-point scale), with a 5.46-point improvement compared to the non-experience integration baseline, when reduced standard deviation by nearly half and enhanced exploration efficiency; (2) the MPC-PPO method achieved a ventilation control reward of 99.19, optimizing ventilation window operations with intelligent time-differentiated strategies that reduced energy loss during non-optimal hours; (3) feature analysis reveals that historical window opening, air temperature, and historical temperature are the most influential features for effective control, i.e., SHAP values of 7.449, 4.905, and 4.747 respectively; and (4) cross-regional tests indicated that MPC-PPO performs best in all test regions, confirming generalization of the method.</p></details>|

Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) aims to streamline this process by automatically generating novel quantum circuits, reducing the need for manual intervention. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based algorithm leveraging the LayerDAG framework to generate new quantum circuits. This method contrasts with other approaches that utilize large language models (LLMs), reinforcement learning (RL), variational autoencoders (VAE), and similar techniques.

We describe the observational configuration, outline the calibration of the data, and discuss the effect of Radio Frequency Interference on different observing epochs. In addition, we present a novel radio continuum imaging strategy, using well known baseline subtraction techniques in radio spectral data, and discuss the applications to the removal of artifacts from sources far from the field center. Additionally, we discuss the nature of a low-level image-wide offset, the so-called ``negative bowl" and simulate our observations in order that we may both properly understand and correct for this artifact. Using these techniques, we present the first total intensity image of the data which achieves an r.m.s. noise of 1.3 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ with a synthesized beam of 4.5\arcsec x 4.0\arcsec, the most sensitive L-band image ever taken at this resolution. We then place this image into the broader context of 1.4 GHz radio continuum surveys in the literature, in terms of image sensitivity and fidelity, and $\mu$ Jy level source counts and P(D) analysis.</p></details>|

However, a significant challenge arises from the limitations of visual encoding, which can result in failures during tasks such as object grasping. Moreover, these models typically suffer from high computational overhead due to their large sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. While these models excel in reasoning and task planning, the substantial computational overhead they incur makes them impractical for real-time robotic environments, where speed and efficiency are paramount. To address the limitations of existing VLA models, we propose NORA, a 3B-parameter model designed to reduce computational overhead while maintaining strong task performance. NORA adopts the Qwen-2.5-VL-3B multimodal model as its backbone, leveraging its superior visual-semantic understanding to enhance visual reasoning and action grounding. Additionally, our \model{} is trained on 970k real-world robot demonstrations and equipped with the FAST+ tokenizer for efficient action sequence generation. Experimental results demonstrate that NORA outperforms existing large-scale VLA models, achieving better task performance with significantly reduced computational overhead, making it a more practical solution for real-time robotic autonomy.</p></details>|

This implies a significant increase in visibility data volumes, scaling as $\mathcal{O}(Q^{2}B)$ for $Q$ antennas and $B$ short-time integration intervals (or batches), calling for efficient data dimensionality reduction techniques. This paper proposes a new approach to data compression during acquisition, coined modulated rank-one projection (MROP). MROP compresses the $Q\times Q$ batchwise covariance matrix into a smaller number $P$ of random rank-one projections and compresses across time by trading $B$ for a smaller number $M$ of random modulations of the ROP measurement vectors. Firstly, we introduce a dual perspective on the MROP acquisition, which can either be understood as random beamforming, or as a post-correlation compression. Secondly, we analyse the noise statistics of MROPs and demonstrate that the random projections induce a uniform noise level across measurements independently of the visibility-weighting scheme used. Thirdly, we propose a detailed analysis of the memory and computational cost requirements across the data acquisition and image reconstruction stages, with comparison to state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction approaches. Finally, the MROP model is validated in simulation for monochromatic intensity imaging, with comparison to the classical and baseline-dependent averaging (BDA) models, and using the uSARA optimisation algorithm for image formation. An extensive experimental setup is considered, with ground-truth images containing diffuse and faint emission and spanning a wide variety of dynamic ranges, and for a range of $uv$ -coverages corresponding to VLA and MeerKAT observation.</p></details>|

While vision-language-action (VLA) models have demonstrated impressive results for end-to-end robot control, it remains an open question how far such models can generalize in the wild. We describe $\pi_{0.5}$, a new model based on $\pi_{0}$ that uses co-training on heterogeneous tasks to enable broad generalization. $\pi_{0.5}$ \ uses data from multiple robots, high-level semantic prediction, web data, and other sources to enable broadly generalizable real-world robotic manipulation. Our system uses a combination of co-training and hybrid multi-modal examples that combine image observations, language commands, object detections, semantic subtask prediction, and low-level actions. Our experiments show that this kind of knowledge transfer is essential for effective generalization, and we demonstrate for the first time that an end-to-end learning-enabled robotic system can perform long-horizon and dexterous manipulation skills, such as cleaning a kitchen or bedroom, in entirely new homes.</p></details>|

Rodriguez et.al.|[2504.15519](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15519)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using JWST near-infrared data of the inner Orion Nebula, \citet{Pearson_McCaughrean_2023} detected 40 binary systems they proposed to be Jupiter-Mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs) -- although their actual nature is still in debate. Only one of the objects, JuMBO\,24, was detected in the radio continuum. Here, we report on new radio continuum (10 GHz) Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) detections of the radio counterpart to JuMBO\,24, and on an unsuccessful search for 5 GHz continuum emission with the High Sensitivity Array (HSA). From our new VLA detections and adopting a distance to the region, we set an upper limit of $\simeq 6$~km~s$^{-1}$ to the velocity of the radio source in the plane of the sky. This upper limit favors an origin for this source similar to that of stars, that is, from a stationary contracting core. The nature of the radio emission remains uncertain but the lack of strong variability (all VLA observations are consistent with a steady flux of $\sim$50 $\mu$ Jy), of detection on long HSA baseline, and of detectable circular polarization in VLA data do not favor a non-thermal origin.</p></details>|

We use observations from Juno's MicroWave Radiometer (MWR), the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to probe for the first time the depth and impact of weather on Jupiter. We use ammonia, the main source of opacity at radio wavelengths on Jupiter, as the tracer for the weather by fitting ammonia anomalies to the MWR brightness temperature variations. We show that the majority of the weather on Jupiter is confined to regions where the clouds are forming. Both the South Equatorial Belt and the Equatorial Zone have surprisingly shallow weather systems (P < 2 bar), and even in the North Equatorial Belt most of the ammonia variations is above the water condensation level (P ~ 6 bar). This confirms that the water condensation layer plays a crucial role in controlling the dynamics and the weather on Jupiter. However, the shallow nature of the weather cannot explain the deep-seated depletion down to 30 bar that the Juno mission has revealed. We do find three features, however, that extend below the water condensation layer: a vortex in the northern hemisphere reaching down to 30 bar, an ammonia plume down to 20-30 bars, and the signature of precipitation down to 20 bar. This work highlights the interplay of large-scale processes (vortices, plumes) and small-scale processes (storms) are responsible for shaping the atmospheric makeup of Jupiter.</p></details>|

The images of NGC6822 reveal filaments, edge-brightened bubbles, diffuse emission, and a plethora of point sources. By contrast, most of the MIR emission in WLM is point-like, with a small amount of extended emission. Compared to solar metallicity galaxies, the ratio of 7.7 $\mu$m intensity ($I_\nu^{F770W}$), tracing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), to 21 $\mu$m intensity ($I_\nu^{F2100W}$), tracing small, warm dust grain emission, is suppressed in these low-metallicity dwarfs. Using ALMA CO(2-1) observations, we find that detected CO intensity versus $I_\nu^{F770W}$ at ~2 pc resolution in dwarfs follows a similar relationship to that at solar metallicity and lower resolution, while the CO versus $I_\nu^{F2100W}$ relationship in dwarfs lies significantly below that derived from solar metallicity galaxies at lower resolution, suggesting more pronounced destruction of CO molecules at low metallicity. Finally, adding in Local Group L-Band Survey VLA 21 cm HI observations, we find that $I_\nu^{F2100W}$ and $I_\nu^{F770W}$ vs. total gas ratios are suppressed in NGC6822 and WLM compared to solar metallicity galaxies. In agreement with dust models, the level of suppression appears to be at least partly accounted for by the reduced galaxy-averaged dust-to-gas and PAH-to-dust mass ratios in the dwarfs. Remaining differences are likely due to spatial variations in dust model parameters, which should be an exciting direction for future work in local dwarf galaxies.</p></details>|

Studies of LMXBs with luminosities up to roughly 20% of the Eddington limit indicate that these outflows generally do not co-occur, suggesting that disk winds might inhibit jets. However, previous observations of LMXBs accreting near or above the Eddington limit show that jets and winds can potentially coexist. To investigate this phenomenon, we carried out a comprehensive multi-wavelength campaign (using VLA, Chandra/HETG, and NICER) on the near-Eddington neutron-star Z source LMXB GX 13+1. NICER and Chandra/HETG observations tracked GX 13+1 across the entire Z-track during high Eddington rates, detecting substantial resonance absorption features originating from the accretion disk wind in all X-ray spectra, which implies a persistent wind presence. Simultaneous VLA observations captured a variable radio jet, with radio emission notably strong during all flaring branch observations-contrary to typical behavior in Z-sources-and weaker when the source was on the normal branch. Interestingly, no clear correlation was found between the radio emission and the wind features. Analysis of VLA radio light curves and simultaneous Chandra/HETG spectra demonstrates that an ionized disk wind and jet outflow can indeed coexist in GX 13+1, suggesting that their launching mechanisms are not necessarily linked in this system.</p></details>|

A capable household robot should recognize ambiguity and ask relevant clarification questions to infer the user intent accurately, leading to more effective task execution. To study this problem, we introduce the Ask-to-Act task, where an embodied agent must fetch a specific object instance given an ambiguous instruction in a home environment. The agent must strategically ask minimal, yet relevant, clarification questions to resolve ambiguity while navigating under partial observability. To solve this problem, we propose a novel approach that fine-tunes multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as vision-language-action (VLA) policies using online reinforcement learning (RL) with LLM-generated rewards. Our method eliminates the need for large-scale human demonstrations or manually engineered rewards for training such agents. We benchmark against strong zero-shot baselines, including GPT-4o, and supervised fine-tuned MLLMs, on our task. Our results demonstrate that our RL-finetuned MLLM outperforms all baselines by a significant margin ( $19.1$-$40.3\%$ ), generalizing well to novel scenes and tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of adapting MLLMs as VLA agents that can act and ask for help using LLM-generated rewards with online RL.</p></details>|

The estimation accuracy and variation can differ significantly across parameters. For instance, inductance estimations are generally more accurate and stable than inductor resistance in a buck converter. However, these performance differences remain to be analyzed with a more systematic approach otherwise the condition monitoring results can be unreliable. Therefore, this paper analyzes the training loss landscape against multiple parameters of a buck converter to provide a systematic explanation of different performances. If the training loss is high and smooth, the estimated circuit parameter typically is accurate and has low variation. Furthermore, a novel physics-informed neural network (PINN) is proposed, offering faster convergence and lower computation requirements compared to an existing PINN method. The proposed method is validated through simulations, where the loss landscape identifies the unreliable parameter estimations, and the PINN can estimate the remaining parameters.</p></details>|

Traditional methods typically require extensive stress-strain or full-field measurements, which are often difficult to obtain in practical settings. To overcome these challenges, we propose a physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based framework that enables the discovery of constitutive models using only sparse measurement data - such as displacement and reaction force - that can be acquired from a single material test. By integrating PINNs with finite element discretization, the framework reconstructs full-field displacement and identifies the underlying strain energy density from predefined candidates, while ensuring consistency with physical laws. A two-stage training process is employed: the Adam optimizer jointly updates neural network parameters and model coefficients to obtain an initial solution, followed by L-BFGS refinement and sparse regression with l_p regularization to extract a parsimonious constitutive model. Validation on benchmark hyperelastic models demonstrates that the proposed method can accurately recover constitutive laws and displacement fields, even when the input data are limited and noisy. These findings highlight the applicability of the proposed framework to experimental scenarios where measurement data are both scarce and noisy.</p></details>|

Although, efficient quantification of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in big multi-scale problems remains challenging. We propose \$PINN a novel method of computing global uncertainty in PDEs using a Bayesian framework, by combining local Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks (BPINN) with domain decomposition. The solution continuity across subdomains is obtained by imposing the flux continuity across the interface of neighboring subdomains. To demonstrate the effectiveness of \$PINN, we conduct a series of computational experiments on PDEs in 1D and 2D spatial domains. Although we have adopted conservative PINNs (cPINNs), the method can be seamlessly extended to other domain decomposition techniques. The results infer that the proposed method recovers the global uncertainty by computing the local uncertainty exactly more efficiently as the uncertainty in each subdomain can be computed concurrently. The robustness of \$ PINN is verified by adding uncorrelated random noise to the training data up to 15% and testing for different domain sizes.</p></details>|

However, the accuracy of PINN solutions is often limited by the treatment of boundary conditions. Conventional penalty-based methods, which incorporate boundary conditions as penalty terms in the loss function, cannot guarantee exact satisfaction of the given boundary conditions and are highly sensitive to the choice of penalty parameters. This paper demonstrates that distance functions, specifically R-functions, can be leveraged to enforce boundary conditions, overcoming these limitations. R-functions provide normalized distance fields, enabling accurate representation of boundary geometries, including non-convex domains, and facilitating various types of boundary conditions. We extend this distance function-based boundary condition imposition method to inverse problems using PINNs and introduce an adaptive weight tuning technique to ensure reliable and efficient inverse analysis. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method through several numerical experiments. Numerical results show that the proposed method solves inverse problems more accurately and efficiently than penalty-based methods, even in the presence of complex non-convex geometries. This approach offers a reliable and efficient framework for inverse analysis using PINNs, with potential applications across a wide range of engineering problems.</p></details>|

Three types of fins (rectangular, elliptical, and triangular) are considered to evaluate the influence of fin geometry, along with four different fin configurations inside the 3D channel to examine the effect of placement. The simulations are conducted at four Reynolds numbers: 5, 20, 40, and 80, in both single-unit (four fins) and double-unit (eight fins) configurations. The goal is to assess pressure drop coefficient, mixing index, and mixing efficiency using the FlexPINN method. Given the challenges in simulating 3D problems with standard PINN, several improvements are introduced. The governing equations are injected into the network as first-order, dimensionless derivatives to enhance accuracy. Transfer learning is used to reduce computational cost, and adaptive loss weighting is applied to improve convergence compared to the vanilla PINN approach. These modifications enable a consistent and flexible architecture that can be used across numerous tested cases. Using the proposed FlexPINN method, the pressure drop coefficient and mixing index are predicted with maximum errors of 3.25% and 2.86%, respectively, compared to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) results. Among all the tested cases, the rectangular fin with configuration C in the double-unit setup at Reynolds number 40 shows the highest mixing efficiency, reaching a value of 1.63.

However, standard training of PINNs using gradient descent (GD) suffers from slow convergence and instability, particularly for high-frequency wavefields. For scattered acoustic wavefield simulation based on Helmholtz equation, we derive a hybrid optimization framework that accelerates training convergence by embedding a least-squares (LS) solver directly into the GD loss function. This formulation enables optimal updates for the linear output layer. Our method is applicable with or without perfectly matched layers (PML), and we provide practical tensor-based implementations for both scenarios. Numerical experiments on benchmark velocity models demonstrate that our approach achieves faster convergence, higher accuracy, and improved stability compared to conventional PINN training. In particular, our results show that the LS-enhanced method converges rapidly even in cases where standard GD-based training fails. The LS solver operates on a small normal matrix, ensuring minimal computational overhead and making the method scalable for large-scale wavefield simulations.</p></details>|

These codes efficiently simulate the progression of SAs, while they still have inherent limitations due to their inconsistent finite difference schemes. The use of empirical schemes incorporating both implicit and explicit formulations inherently induces unidirectional coupling in multi-physics analyses. The objective of this study is to develop a novel numerical method for TH system codes using physics-informed neural network (PINN). They have shown strength in solving multi-physics due to the innate feature of neural networks-automatic differentiation. We propose a node-assigned PINN (NA-PINN) that is suitable for the control volume approach-based system codes. NA-PINN addresses the issue of spatial governing equation variation by assigning an individual network to each nodalization of the system code, such that spatial information is excluded from both the input and output domains, and each subnetwork learns to approximate a purely temporal solution. In this phase, we evaluated the accuracy of the PINN methods for the hydrodynamic module. In the 6 water tank simulation, PINN and NA-PINN showed maximum absolute errors of 1.678 and 0.007, respectively. It should be noted that only NA-PINN demonstrated acceptable accuracy. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to successfully implement a system code using PINN.

Traditional sampling methods like molecular dynamics (MD) or MCMC often struggle with the high-dimensional nature of molecular systems and the high energy barriers of transitions between stable states. While these transitions are rare events in simulation timescales, they often represent the most biologically significant processes - for example, the conformational change of an ion channel protein from its closed to open state, which controls cellular ion flow and is crucial for neural signaling. Such transitions in real systems may take milliseconds to seconds but could require months or years of continuous simulation to observe even once. We present a method that reformulates transition path generation as a continuous optimization problem solved through physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) inspired by string methods for minimum-energy path (MEP) generation. By representing transition paths as implicit neural functions and leveraging automatic differentiation with differentiable molecular dynamics force fields, our method enables the efficient discovery of physically realistic transition pathways without requiring expensive path sampling. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on two proteins, including an explicitly hydrated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) system with over 8,300 atoms.</p></details>|
