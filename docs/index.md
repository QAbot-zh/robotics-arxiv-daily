|**2025-05-14**|**Camera-Only 3D Panoptic Scene Completion for Autonomous Driving through Differentiable Object Shapes**|Nicola Marinello et.al.|[2505.09562](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09562)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles need a complete map of their surroundings to plan and act. This has sparked research into the tasks of 3D occupancy prediction, 3D scene completion, and 3D panoptic scene completion, which predict a dense map of the ego vehicle's surroundings as a voxel grid. Scene completion extends occupancy prediction by predicting occluded regions of the voxel grid, and panoptic scene completion further extends this task by also distinguishing object instances within the same class; both aspects are crucial for path planning and decision-making. However, 3D panoptic scene completion is currently underexplored. This work introduces a novel framework for 3D panoptic scene completion that extends existing 3D semantic scene completion models. We propose an Object Module and Panoptic Module that can easily be integrated with 3D occupancy and scene completion methods presented in the literature. Our approach leverages the available annotations in occupancy benchmarks, allowing individual object shapes to be learned as a differentiable problem.

|**2025-05-14**|**aUToPath: Unified Planning and Control for Autonomous Vehicles in Urban Environments Using Hybrid Lattice and Free-Space Search**|Tanmay P. Patel et.al.|[2505.09475](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09475)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper presents aUToPath, a unified online framework for global path-planning and control to address the challenge of autonomous navigation in cluttered urban environments. A key component of our framework is a novel hybrid planner that combines pre-computed lattice maps with dynamic free-space sampling to efficiently generate optimal driveable corridors in cluttered scenarios. Our system also features sequential convex programming (SCP)-based model predictive control (MPC) to refine the corridors into smooth, dynamically consistent trajectories. A single optimization problem is used to both generate a trajectory and its corresponding control commands; this addresses limitations of decoupled approaches by guaranteeing a safe and feasible path. Simulation results of the novel planner on randomly generated obstacle-rich scenarios demonstrate the success rate of a free-space Adaptively Informed Trees* (AIT*)-based planner, and runtimes comparable to a lattice-based planner. Real-world experiments of the full system on a Chevrolet Bolt EUV further validate performance in dense obstacle fields, demonstrating no violations of traffic, kinematic, or vehicle constraints, and a 100% success rate across eight trials.</p></details>|
|**2025-05-15**|**SafePath: Conformal Prediction for Safe LLM-Based Autonomous Navigation**|Achref Doula et.al.|[2505.09427](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09427)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) show growing promise in autonomous driving by reasoning over complex traffic scenarios to generate path plans. However, their tendencies toward overconfidence, and hallucinations raise critical safety concerns. We introduce SafePath, a modular framework that augments LLM-based path planning with formal safety guarantees using conformal prediction. SafePath operates in three stages. In the first stage, we use an LLM that generates a set of diverse candidate paths, exploring possible trajectories based on agent behaviors and environmental cues. In the second stage, SafePath filters out high-risk trajectories while guaranteeing that at least one safe option is included with a user-defined probability, through a multiple-choice question-answering formulation that integrates conformal prediction. In the final stage, our approach selects the path with the lowest expected collision risk when uncertainty is low or delegates control to a human when uncertainty is high. We theoretically prove that SafePath guarantees a safe trajectory with a user-defined probability, and we show how its human delegation rate can be tuned to balance autonomy and safety. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and Highway-env show that SafePath reduces planning uncertainty by 77\% and collision rates by up to 70\%, demonstrating effectiveness in making LLM-driven path planning more safer.</p></details>|

By removing the need for predefined motion inputs, it provides a flexible and accessible approach to controlling animated characters. This makes it especially useful in areas like virtual reality, gaming, human-computer interaction, and robotics. In this review, we first revisit the traditional perspective on motion synthesis, where models focused on predicting future poses from observed initial sequences, often conditioned on action labels. We then provide a comprehensive and structured survey of modern text-to-motion generation approaches, categorizing them from two complementary perspectives: (i) architectural, dividing methods into VAE-based, diffusion-based, and hybrid models; and (ii) motion representation, distinguishing between discrete and continuous motion generation strategies. In addition, we explore the most widely used datasets, evaluation methods, and recent benchmarks that have shaped progress in this area. With this survey, we aim to capture where the field currently stands, bring attention to its key challenges and limitations, and highlight promising directions for future exploration. We hope this work offers a valuable starting point for researchers and practitioners working to push the boundaries of language-driven human motion synthesis.</p></details>|

This class of vehicle is designed to perform small-distance transportation of passengers and goods in structured environments. Our approach leverages mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) to compute global optimal collision-free trajectories taking into account the kinematics and dynamics of the vehicle. We propose novel constraints for intersample collision avoidance and demonstrate its effectiveness using pick-up and delivery missions and statistical analysis of Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that the novel formulation provides the best trajectories in terms of time expenditure and control effort when compared to two state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details>|

Transferring its capabilities to modern autonomous driving systems has also emerged as a promising direction.In this work, we propose TransDiffuser, an encoder-decoder based generative trajectory planning model for end-to-end autonomous driving. The encoded scene information serves as the multi-modal conditional input of the denoising decoder. To tackle the mode collapse dilemma in generating high-quality diverse trajectories, we introduce a simple yet effective multi-modal representation decorrelation optimization mechanism during the training process.TransDiffuser achieves PDMS of 94.85 on the NAVSIM benchmark, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods without any anchor-based prior trajectories.</p></details>|
|**2025-05-14**|**Robot-Assisted Drone Recovery on a Wavy Surface Using Error-State Kalman Filter and Receding Horizon Model Predictive Control**|Yimou Wu et.al.|[2505.09145](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09145)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recovering a drone on a disturbed water surface remains a significant challenge in maritime robotics. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for Robot-Assisted Drone Recovery on a Wavy Surface that addresses two major tasks: Firstly, accurate prediction of a moving drone's position under wave-induced disturbances using an Error-State Kalman Filter (ESKF), and secondly, effective motion planning for a manipulator via Receding Horizon Control (RHC). Specifically, the ESKF predicts the drone's future position 0.5s ahead, while the manipulator plans a capture trajectory in real time, thus overcoming not only wave-induced base motions but also limited torque constraints. We provide a system design that comprises a manipulator subsystem and a UAV subsystem. On the UAV side, we detail how position control and suspended payload strategies are implemented. On the manipulator side, we show how an RHC scheme outperforms traditional low-level control algorithms. Simulation and real-world experiments - using wave-disturbed motion data - demonstrate that our approach achieves a high success rate - above 95% and outperforms conventional baseline methods by up to 10% in efficiency and 20% in precision. The results underscore the feasibility and robustness of our system, which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and offers a practical solution for maritime drone operations.</p></details>|
|**2025-05-13**|**Multi-step manipulation task and motion planning guided by video demonstration**|Kateryna Zorina et.al.|[2505.08949](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08949)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This work aims to leverage instructional video to solve complex multi-step task-and-motion planning tasks in robotics. Towards this goal, we propose an extension of the well-established Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) planner, which simultaneously grows multiple trees around grasp and release states extracted from the guiding video. Our key novelty lies in combining contact states and 3D object poses extracted from the guiding video with a traditional planning algorithm that allows us to solve tasks with sequential dependencies, for example, if an object needs to be placed at a specific location to be grasped later. We also investigate the generalization capabilities of our approach to go beyond the scene depicted in the instructional video. To demonstrate the benefits of the proposed video-guided planning approach, we design a new benchmark with three challenging tasks: (I) 3D re-arrangement of multiple objects between a table and a shelf, (ii) multi-step transfer of an object through a tunnel, and (iii) transferring objects using a tray similar to a waiter transfers dishes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our planning algorithm on several robots, including the Franka Emika Panda and the KUKA KMR iiwa. For a seamless transfer of the obtained plans to the real robot, we develop a trajectory refinement approach formulated as an optimal control problem (OCP).</p></details>|
|**2025-05-13**|**Optimal Trajectory Planning with Collision Avoidance for Autonomous Vehicle Maneuvering**|Jason Zalev et.al.|[2505.08724](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08724)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>To perform autonomous driving maneuvers, such as parallel or perpendicular parking, a vehicle requires continual speed and steering adjustments to follow a generated path. In consequence, the path's quality is a limiting factor of the vehicle maneuver's performance. While most path planning approaches include finding a collision-free route, optimal trajectory planning involves solving the best transition from initial to final states, minimizing the action over all paths permitted by a kinematic model. Here we propose a novel method based on sequential convex optimization, which permits flexible and efficient optimal trajectory generation. The objective is to achieve the fastest time, shortest distance, and fewest number of path segments to satisfy motion requirements, while avoiding sensor blind-spots. In our approach, vehicle kinematics are represented by a discretized Dubins model. To avoid collisions, each waypoint is constrained by linear inequalities representing closest distance of obstacles to a polygon specifying the vehicle's extent. To promote smooth and valid trajectories, the solved kinematic state and control variables are constrained and regularized by penalty terms in the model's cost function, which enforces physical restrictions including limits for steering angle, acceleration and speed. In this paper, we analyze trajectories obtained for several parking scenarios. Results demonstrate efficient and collision-free motion generated by the proposed technique.</p></details>|

We address these limitations by integrating DMP controllers into a BT framework, jointly learning the BT structure and DMP actions from single demonstrations, thereby removing the need for predefined actions. Additionally, by combining BT decision logic with DMP motion generation, our method enhances policy interpretability, modularity, and adaptability for autonomous systems. Our approach readily affords both learning to replicate low-level motions and combining partial demonstrations into a coherent and easy-to-modify overall policy.</p></details>|

However, while these policies achieve strong mean performance across a variety of tasks, they often underperform on individual, specialized tasks and require further tuning on newly acquired task-specific data. Combining task-specific data with carefully curated subsets of large prior datasets via co-training can produce better specialized policies, but selecting data naively may actually harm downstream performance. To address this, we introduce DataMIL, a policy-driven data selection framework built on the datamodels paradigm that reasons about data selection in an end-to-end manner, using the policy itself to identify which data points will most improve performance. Unlike standard practices that filter data using human notions of quality (e.g., based on semantic or visual similarity), DataMIL directly optimizes data selection for task success, allowing us to select data that enhance the policy while dropping data that degrade it. To avoid performing expensive rollouts in the environment during selection, we use a novel surrogate loss function on task-specific data, allowing us to use DataMIL in the real world without degrading performance. We validate our approach on a suite of more than 60 simulation and real-world manipulation tasks - most notably showing successful data selection from the Open X-Embodiment datasets-demonstrating consistent gains in success rates and superior performance over multiple baselines. Our results underscore the importance of end-to-end, performance-aware data selection for unlocking the potential of large prior datasets in robotics.

Yet the prevailing data collection paradigm-human teleoperation-remains costly and constrained by manual effort and physical robot access. We introduce Real2Render2Real (R2R2R), a novel approach for generating robot training data without relying on object dynamics simulation or teleoperation of robot hardware. The input is a smartphone-captured scan of one or more objects and a single video of a human demonstration. R2R2R renders thousands of high visual fidelity robot-agnostic demonstrations by reconstructing detailed 3D object geometry and appearance, and tracking 6-DoF object motion. R2R2R uses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to enable flexible asset generation and trajectory synthesis for both rigid and articulated objects, converting these representations to meshes to maintain compatibility with scalable rendering engines like IsaacLab but with collision modeling off. Robot demonstration data generated by R2R2R integrates directly with models that operate on robot proprioceptive states and image observations, such as vision-language-action models (VLA) and imitation learning policies. Physical experiments suggest that models trained on R2R2R data from a single human demonstration can match the performance of models trained on 150 human teleoperation demonstrations.

To bridge this gap, we introduce Vision-Tactile-Language-Action model, a novel framework that enables robust policy generation in contact-intensive scenarios by effectively integrating visual and tactile inputs through cross-modal language grounding. A low-cost, multi-modal dataset has been constructed in a simulation environment, containing vision-tactile-action-instruction pairs specifically designed for the fingertip insertion task. Furthermore, we introduce Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to offer regression-like supervision for the VTLA model, effectively bridging the gap between classification-based next token prediction loss and continuous robotic tasks. Experimental results show that the VTLA model outperforms traditional imitation learning methods (e.g., diffusion policies) and existing multi-modal baselines (TLA/VLA), achieving over 90% success rates on unseen peg shapes.

As a result, the integration of RLHF has greatly enhanced the outputs of these large language models (LLMs) and made the interactions and responses appear more "human-like" than those of previous versions using only supervised learning. The increasing convergence of human and machine-written text has potentially severe ethical, sociotechnical, and pedagogical implications relating to transparency, trust, bias, and interpersonal relations. To highlight these implications, this paper presents a rhetorical analysis of some of the central procedures and processes currently being reshaped by RLHF-enhanced generative AI chatbots: upholding language conventions, information seeking practices, and expectations for social relationships. Rhetorical investigations of generative AI and LLMs have, to this point, focused largely on the persuasiveness of the content generated. Using Ian Bogost's concept of procedural rhetoric, this paper shifts the site of rhetorical investigation from content analysis to the underlying mechanisms of persuasion built into RLHF-enhanced LLMs. In doing so, this theoretical investigation opens a new direction for further inquiry in AI ethics that considers how procedures rerouted through AI-driven technologies might reinforce hegemonic language use, perpetuate biases, decontextualize learning, and encroach upon human relationships. It will therefore be of interest to educators, researchers, scholars, and the growing number of users of generative AI chatbots.</p></details>|

Yet, learning effective long-context policies from demonstrations remains challenging. As context length increases, training becomes increasingly expensive due to rising memory demands, and policy performance often degrades as a result of spurious correlations. Recent methods typically sidestep these issues by truncating context length, discarding historical information that may be critical for subsequent decisions. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach that explicitly regularizes the retention of past information. We first revisit the copycat problem in imitation learning and identify an opposite challenge in recent diffusion policies: rather than over-relying on prior actions, they often fail to capture essential dependencies between past and future actions. To address this, we introduce Past-Token Prediction (PTP), an auxiliary task in which the policy learns to predict past action tokens alongside future ones. This regularization significantly improves temporal modeling in the policy head, with minimal reliance on visual representations. Building on this observation, we further introduce a multistage training strategy: pre-train the visual encoder with short contexts, and fine-tune the policy head using cached long-context embeddings. This strategy preserves the benefits of PTP while greatly reducing memory and computational overhead. Finally, we extend PTP into a self-verification mechanism at test time, enabling the policy to score and select candidates consistent with past actions during inference. Experiments across four real-world and six simulated tasks demonstrate that our proposed method improves the performance of long-context diffusion policies by 3x and accelerates policy training by more than 10x.</p></details>|

However, the evaluation of spoken dialogue models' conversational performance has largely been overlooked. This is primarily due to the intelligent chatbots convey a wealth of non-textual information which cannot be easily measured using text-based language models like ChatGPT. To address this gap, we propose WavReward, a reward feedback model based on audio language models that can evaluate both the IQ and EQ of spoken dialogue systems with speech input. Specifically, 1) based on audio language models, WavReward incorporates the deep reasoning process and the nonlinear reward mechanism for post-training. By utilizing multi-sample feedback via the reinforcement learning algorithm, we construct a specialized evaluator tailored to spoken dialogue models. 2) We introduce ChatReward-30K, a preference dataset used to train WavReward. ChatReward-30K includes both comprehension and generation aspects of spoken dialogue models. These scenarios span various tasks, such as text-based chats, nine acoustic attributes of instruction chats, and implicit chats. WavReward outperforms previous state-of-the-art evaluation models across multiple spoken dialogue scenarios, achieving a substantial improvement about Qwen2.5-Omni in objective accuracy from 55.1 $\%$ to 91.5$\%$. In subjective A/B testing, WavReward also leads by a margin of 83$\%$ . Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the necessity of each component of WavReward.

A key challenge is information asymmetry: the student cannot directly access the teacher's state space, leading to distributional shifts and policy degradation. Existing approaches either modify the teacher to produce realizable but sub-optimal demonstrations or rely on the student to explore missing information independently, both of which are inefficient. Our key insight is that the student should strategically interact with the teacher --querying only when necessary and resetting from recovery states --to stay on a recoverable path within its own observation space. We introduce two methods: (i) an imitation learning approach that adaptively determines when the student should query the teacher for corrections, and (ii) a reinforcement learning approach that selects where to initialize training for efficient exploration. We validate our methods in both simulated and real-world robotic tasks, demonstrating significant improvements over standard teacher-student baselines in training efficiency and final performance.

Learning from heterogeneous data is one of the fundamental challenges in offline RL. Traditional methods focus on learning an optimal policy for all individuals with pre-collected data from a single episode or homogeneous batch episodes, and thus, may result in a suboptimal policy for a heterogeneous population. In this paper, we propose an individualized offline policy optimization framework for heterogeneous time-stationary Markov decision processes (MDPs). The proposed heterogeneous model with individual latent variables enables us to efficiently estimate the individual Q-functions, and our Penalized Pessimistic Personalized Policy Learning (P4L) algorithm guarantees a fast rate on the average regret under a weak partial coverage assumption on behavior policies. In addition, our simulation studies and a real data application demonstrate the superior numerical performance of the proposed method compared with existing methods.</p></details>|

Recent work has shown that deep linear networks tend to be resilient towards loss of plasticity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Adaptive Linearization (AdaLin), a general approach that dynamically adapts each neuron's activation function to mitigate plasticity loss. Unlike prior methods that rely on regularization or periodic resets, AdaLin equips every neuron with a learnable parameter and a gating mechanism that injects linearity into the activation function based on its gradient flow. This adaptive modulation ensures sufficient gradient signal and sustains continual learning without introducing additional hyperparameters or requiring explicit task boundaries. When used with conventional activation functions like ReLU, Tanh, and GeLU, we demonstrate that AdaLin can significantly improve performance on standard benchmarks, including Random Label and Permuted MNIST, Random Label and Shuffled CIFAR-10, and Class-Split CIFAR-100. Furthermore, its efficacy is shown in more complex scenarios, such as class-incremental learning on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet-18 backbone, and in mitigating plasticity loss in off-policy reinforcement learning agents. We perform a systematic set of ablations that show that neuron-level adaptation is crucial for good performance and analyze a number of metrics in the network that might be correlated to loss of plasticity.</p></details>|

Yet the prevailing data collection paradigm-human teleoperation-remains costly and constrained by manual effort and physical robot access. We introduce Real2Render2Real (R2R2R), a novel approach for generating robot training data without relying on object dynamics simulation or teleoperation of robot hardware. The input is a smartphone-captured scan of one or more objects and a single video of a human demonstration. R2R2R renders thousands of high visual fidelity robot-agnostic demonstrations by reconstructing detailed 3D object geometry and appearance, and tracking 6-DoF object motion. R2R2R uses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to enable flexible asset generation and trajectory synthesis for both rigid and articulated objects, converting these representations to meshes to maintain compatibility with scalable rendering engines like IsaacLab but with collision modeling off. Robot demonstration data generated by R2R2R integrates directly with models that operate on robot proprioceptive states and image observations, such as vision-language-action models (VLA) and imitation learning policies. Physical experiments suggest that models trained on R2R2R data from a single human demonstration can match the performance of models trained on 150 human teleoperation demonstrations.

To bridge this gap, we introduce Vision-Tactile-Language-Action model, a novel framework that enables robust policy generation in contact-intensive scenarios by effectively integrating visual and tactile inputs through cross-modal language grounding. A low-cost, multi-modal dataset has been constructed in a simulation environment, containing vision-tactile-action-instruction pairs specifically designed for the fingertip insertion task. Furthermore, we introduce Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to offer regression-like supervision for the VTLA model, effectively bridging the gap between classification-based next token prediction loss and continuous robotic tasks. Experimental results show that the VTLA model outperforms traditional imitation learning methods (e.g., diffusion policies) and existing multi-modal baselines (TLA/VLA), achieving over 90% success rates on unseen peg shapes. Finally, we conduct real-world peg-in-hole experiments to demonstrate the exceptional Sim2Real performance of the proposed VTLA model.

While modern Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can handle diverse robotic tasks, they often incur high per-step inference costs, resulting in significant latency, sometimes minutes per task. In contrast, RT-cache stores a large-scale Memory of previously successful robot trajectories and retrieves relevant multistep motion snippets, drastically reducing inference overhead. By integrating a Memory Builder with a Trajectory Retrieval, we develop an efficient retrieval process that remains tractable even for extremely large datasets. RT-cache flexibly accumulates real-world experiences and replays them whenever the current scene matches past states, adapting quickly to new or unseen environments with only a few additional samples. Experiments on the Open-X Embodiment Dataset and other real-world data demonstrate that RT-cache completes tasks both faster and more successfully than a baseline lacking retrieval, suggesting a practical, data-driven solution for real-time manipulation.</p></details>|

Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, while building on top of general Vision-Language Models (VLMs), still fall short of achieving robust zero-shot performance due to the scarcity and heterogeneity prevalent in embodied datasets. To address these limitations, we propose FSD (From Seeing to Doing), a novel vision-language model that generates intermediate representations through spatial relationship reasoning, providing fine-grained guidance for robotic manipulation. Our approach combines a hierarchical data pipeline for training with a self-consistency mechanism that aligns spatial coordinates with visual signals. Through extensive experiments, we comprehensively validated FSD's capabilities in both "seeing" and "doing," achieving outstanding performance across 8 benchmarks for general spatial reasoning and embodied reference abilities, as well as on our proposed more challenging benchmark VABench. We also verified zero-shot capabilities in robot manipulation, demonstrating significant performance improvements over baseline methods in both SimplerEnv and real robot settings. Experimental results show that FSD achieves 54.1% success rate in SimplerEnv and 72% success rate across 8 real-world tasks, outperforming the strongest baseline by 30%.</p></details>|

While such approaches have been shown to improve performance and generalization, they suffer from core limitations, like needing specialized robot reasoning data and slow inference speeds. To design new robot reasoning approaches that address these issues, a more complete characterization of why reasoning helps policy performance is critical. We hypothesize several mechanisms by which robot reasoning improves policies -- (1) better representation learning, (2) improved learning curricularization, and (3) increased expressivity -- then devise simple variants of robot CoT reasoning to isolate and test each one. We find that learning to generate reasonings does lead to better VLA representations, while attending to the reasonings aids in actually leveraging these features for improved action prediction. Our results provide us with a better understanding of why CoT reasoning helps VLAs, which we use to introduce two simple and lightweight alternative recipes for robot reasoning. Our proposed approaches achieve significant performance gains over non-reasoning policies, state-of-the-art results on the LIBERO-90 benchmark, and a 3x inference speedup compared to standard robot reasoning.</p></details>|

However, most existing approaches heavily rely on scaling action-annotated data to enhance their capabilities. Consequently, they are often limited to single physical specification and struggle to learn transferable knowledge across different embodiments and environments. To confront these limitations, we propose UniVLA, a new framework for learning cross-embodiment vision-language-action (VLA) policies. Our key innovation is to derive task-centric action representations from videos with a latent action model. This enables us to exploit extensive data across a wide spectrum of embodiments and perspectives. To mitigate the effect of task-irrelevant dynamics, we incorporate language instructions and establish a latent action model within the DINO feature space. Learned from internet-scale videos, the generalist policy can be deployed to various robots through efficient latent action decoding. We obtain state-of-the-art results across multiple manipulation and navigation benchmarks, as well as real-robot deployments. UniVLA achieves superior performance over OpenVLA with less than 1/20 of pretraining compute and 1/10 of downstream data. Continuous performance improvements are observed as heterogeneous data, even including human videos, are incorporated into the training pipeline. The results underscore UniVLA's potential to facilitate scalable and efficient robot policy learning.</p></details>|

Robots must possess semantic and visual perception abilities to transform real-world mappings of their workspace into the low-level control necessary for object manipulation. Recent work has demonstrated the capabilities of fine-tuning large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to learn the mapping between RGB images, language instructions, and joint space control. These models typically take as input RGB images of the workspace and language instructions, and are trained on large datasets of teleoperated robot demonstrations. In this work, we explore methods to improve the scene context awareness of a popular recent Vision-Language-Action model by integrating chain-of-thought reasoning, depth perception, and task-oriented region of interest detection. Our experiments in the LIBERO simulation environment show that our proposed model, 3D-CAVLA, improves the success rate across various LIBERO task suites, achieving an average success rate of 98.1$\%$. We also evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of our method, demonstrating that 3D scene awareness leads to robust learning and adaptation for completely unseen tasks. 3D-CAVLA achieves an absolute improvement of 8.8$\%$ on unseen tasks.

Our analysis reveals several critical insights: (1) all evaluated models exhibit significant limitations in zero-shot generalization to OOD tasks, with performance heavily influenced by factors such as action representation and task complexit; (2) VLAs generally outperform other models due to their robust architectural design; and (3) VLM variants demonstrate substantial improvements when constrained appropriately, highlighting the sensitivity of model performance to precise prompt engineering.</p></details>|

This foundational review presents a comprehensive synthesis of recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action models, systematically organized across five thematic pillars that structure the landscape of this rapidly evolving field. We begin by establishing the conceptual foundations of VLA systems, tracing their evolution from cross-modal learning architectures to generalist agents that tightly integrate vision-language models (VLMs), action planners, and hierarchical controllers. Our methodology adopts a rigorous literature review framework, covering over 80 VLA models published in the past three years. Key progress areas include architectural innovations, parameter-efficient training strategies, and real-time inference accelerations. We explore diverse application domains such as humanoid robotics, autonomous vehicles, medical and industrial robotics, precision agriculture, and augmented reality navigation. The review further addresses major challenges across real-time control, multimodal action representation, system scalability, generalization to unseen tasks, and ethical deployment risks. Drawing from the state-of-the-art, we propose targeted solutions including agentic AI adaptation, cross-embodiment generalization, and unified neuro-symbolic planning. In our forward-looking discussion, we outline a future roadmap where VLA models, VLMs, and agentic AI converge to power socially aligned, adaptive, and general-purpose embodied agents. This work serves as a foundational reference for advancing intelligent, real-world robotics and artificial general intelligence. >Vision-language-action, Agentic AI, AI Agents, Vision-language Models</p></details>|

Yet their original formulation is computationally and memory intensive, motivating the introduction of Chebyshev Type-I-based KANs (Chebyshev1KANs). Although Chebyshev1KANs have outperformed the vanilla KANs architecture, our rigorous theoretical analysis reveals that they still suffer from rank collapse, ultimately limiting their expressive capacity. To overcome these limitations, we enhance Chebyshev1KANs by integrating wavelet-activated MLPs with learnable parameters and an internal attention mechanism. We prove that this design preserves a full-rank Jacobian and is capable of approximating solutions to PDEs of arbitrary order. Furthermore, to alleviate the loss instability and imbalance introduced by the Chebyshev polynomial basis, we externally incorporate a Residual Gradient Attention (RGA) mechanism that dynamically re-weights individual loss terms according to their gradient norms and residual magnitudes. By jointly leveraging internal and external attention, we present AC-PKAN, a novel architecture that constitutes an enhancement to weakly supervised Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and extends the expressive power of KANs. Experimental results from nine benchmark tasks across three domains show that AC-PKAN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art models such as PINNsFormer, establishing it as a highly effective tool for solving complex real-world engineering problems in zero-data or data-sparse regimes. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details>|

The TransNet is a two-layer neural network with specially pre-trained hidden-layer neurons. In the proposed MAE-TransNet, the inner and outer solutions produced from the matched asymptotic expansions are first approximated by a TransNet with nonuniform hidden-layer neurons and a TransNet with uniform hidden-layer neurons, respectively. Then, these two solutions are combined with a matching term to obtain the composite solution, which approximates the asymptotic expansion solution of the singular perturbation problem. This process enables the MAE-TransNet method to retain the precision of the matched asymptotic expansions while maintaining the efficiency and accuracy of TransNet. Meanwhile, the rescaling of the sharp region allows the same pre-trained network parameters to be applied to boundary layers with various thicknesses, thereby improving the transferability of the method. Notably, for coupled boundary layer problems, a computational framework based on MAE-TransNet is also constructed to effectively address issues resulting from the lack of relevant matched asymptotic expansion theory in such problems. Our MAE-TransNet is compared with TransNet, PINN, and Boundary-Layer PINN on various benchmark problems including 1D linear and nonlinear problems with boundary layers, the 2D Couette flow problem, a 2D coupled boundary layer problem, and the 3D Burgers vortex problem. Numerical results demonstrate that MAE-TransNet significantly outperforms other neural network methods in capturing the characteristics of boundary layers, improving the accuracy, and reducing the computational cost.</p></details>|

Sparsity-promoting regularization is employed to prevent over-parameterization and reduce redundant features. This work is motivated by longstanding challenges in traditional RBF collocation methods, along with the limitations of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and Gaussian process (GP) approaches, aiming to blend their respective strengths in a unified framework. The theoretical foundation of our approach lies in the function space of Reproducing Kernel Banach Spaces (RKBS) induced by one-hidden-layer neural networks of possibly infinite width. We prove a representer theorem showing that the solution to the sparse optimization problem in the RKBS admits a finite solution and establishes error bounds that offer a foundation for generalizing classical numerical analysis. The algorithmic framework is based on a three-phase algorithm to maintain computational efficiency through adaptive feature selection, second-order optimization, and pruning of inactive neurons. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and highlight cases where it offers notable advantages over GP approaches. This work opens new directions for adaptive PDE solvers grounded in rigorous analysis with efficient, learning-inspired implementation.</p></details>|

As PINNs are not naturally equipped with mechanisms for Uncertainty Quantification, some work has been done to quantify the different uncertainties that arise when dealing with PINNs. In this paper, we use a two-step procedure to train Bayesian Neural Networks that provide uncertainties over the solutions to differential equation systems provided by PINNs. We use available error bounds over PINNs to formulate a heteroscedastic variance that improves the uncertainty estimation. Furthermore, we solve forward problems and utilize the obtained uncertainties when doing parameter estimation in inverse problems in cosmology.</p></details>|

However, the internal covariate shift, which has been largely overlooked, hinders the effective utilization of neural network capacity in PINNs. To this end, we propose Mask-PINNs, a novel architecture designed to address this issue in PINNs. Unlike traditional normalization methods such as BatchNorm or LayerNorm, we introduce a learnable, nonlinear mask function that constrains the feature distributions without violating underlying physics. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves feature distribution stability, accuracy, and robustness across various activation functions and PDE benchmarks. Furthermore, it enables the stable and efficient training of wider networks a capability that has been largely overlooked in PINNs.</p></details>|

|**2025-05-08**|**Seismic first-arrival traveltime simulation based on reciprocity-constrained PINN**|Hang Geng et.al.|[2505.05061](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05061)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Simulating seismic first-arrival traveltime plays a crucial role in seismic tomography. First-arrival traveltime simulation relies on solving the eikonal equation. The accuracy of conventional numerical solvers is limited to a finite-difference approximation. In recent years, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been applied to achieve this task. However, traditional PINNs encounter challenges in accurately solving the eikonal equation, especially in cases where the model exhibits directional scaling differences. These challenges result in substantial traveltime prediction errors when the traveling distance is long. To improve the accuracy of PINN in traveltime prediction, we incorporate the reciprocity principle as a constraint into the PINN training framework. Based on the reciprocity principle, which states that the traveltime between two points remains invariant when their roles as source and receiver are exchanged, we propose to apply this principle to multiple source-receiver pairs in PINN-based traveltime prediction. Furthermore, a dynamic weighting mechanism is proposed to balance the contributions of the eikonal equation loss and the reciprocity-constrained loss during the training process. This adaptive weighting evolves dynamically with the training epochs, enhancing the convergency of the training process. Experiments conducted on a simple lens velocity model, the Overthrust velocity model, and a 3D velocity model demonstrate that the introduction of the reciprocity-constrained PINN significantly improves the accuracy of traveltime predictions.</p></details>|

Parameterized governing equations of the system are used in tandem with the measurements to regularize the regression problem. However, in real-world solution reconstruction problems, the parameterized governing equation may be inconsistent with the physical phenomena that give rise to the measurement data. We show that due to assuming consistency between the true and parameterized physics, PINNs-based approaches may fail to satisfy three basic criteria of interpretability, robustness, and data consistency. As we argue, these criteria ensure that (i) the quality of the reconstruction can be assessed, (ii) the reconstruction does not depend strongly on the choice of physics loss, and (iii) that in certain situations, the physics parameters can be uniquely recovered. In the context of elasticity and heat transfer, we demonstrate how standard formulations of the physics loss and techniques for constraining the solution to respect the measurement data lead to different ``constraint forces" -- which we define as additional source terms arising from the constraints -- and that these constraint forces can significantly influence the reconstructed solution. To avoid the potentially substantial influence of the choice of physics loss and method of constraint enforcement on the reconstructed solution, we propose the ``explicit constraint force method'' (ECFM) to gain control of the source term introduced by the constraint. We then show that by satisfying the criteria of interpretability, robustness, and data consistency, this approach leads to more predictable and customizable reconstructions from noisy measurement data, even when the parameterization of the missing physics is inconsistent with the measured system.</p></details>|

Keller et.al.|[2505.04865](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04865)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Current, realistic numerical simulations of the solar atmosphere reproduce observations in a statistical sense; they do not replicate observations such as a movie of solar granulation. Inversions on the other hand reproduce observations by design, but the resulting models are often not physically self-consistent. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a new approach to solving the time-dependent radiative hydrodynamics equations and matching observations as boundary conditions. PINNs approximate the solution of the integro-differential equations with a deep neural network. The parameters of this network are determined by minimizing the residuals with respect to the physics equations and the observations. The resulting models are continuous in all dimensions, can zoom into local areas of interest in space and time, and provide information on physical parameters that are not necessarily directly observed such as horizontal velocities. Here we present the first proof of concept of this novel approach, explain the underlying methodology in detail, and provide an outlook to the many applications that PINNs enable.</p></details>|
