Our vision is to design a fully autonomous prototype that can find its way to the next parking spot, high-demand area, or charging station. In this work, we propose a path following solution to enable localization and navigation in an urban environment with a provided path to follow. We design a closed-loop architecture that solves the localization and path following problem while allowing the e-scooter to maintain its balance with a previously developed reaction wheel mechanism. Our approach facilitates state and input constraints, e.g., adhering to the path width, while remaining executable on a Raspberry Pi 5. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a real-world experiment on our prototype.</p></details>|

The method combines a forward-backward solver for online velocity optimization with a novel spatial sampling strategy for local trajectory planning, utilizing a three-dimensional track representation. The computed velocity profile serves as a reference for the local planner, ensuring adaptability to environmental and vehicle dynamics. We demonstrate the approach's robust performance and computational efficiency in racing scenarios and discuss its limitations, including sensitivity to deviations from the predefined racing line and high jerk characteristics of the velocity profile.</p></details>|
|**2025-05-08**|**CPP-DIP: Multi-objective Coverage Path Planning for MAVs in Dispersed and Irregular Plantations**|Weijie Kuang et.al.|[2505.04989](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04989)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is vital in precision agriculture to improve efficiency and resource utilization. In irregular and dispersed plantations, traditional grid-based CPP often causes redundant coverage over non-vegetated areas, leading to waste and pollution. To overcome these limitations, we propose CPP-DIP, a multi-objective CPP framework designed for Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs). The framework transforms the CPP task into a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and optimizes flight paths by minimizing travel distance, turning angles, and intersection counts. Unlike conventional approaches, our method does not rely on GPS-based environmental modeling. Instead, it uses aerial imagery and a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)-based approach to detect trees and extract image coordinates. A density-aware waypoint strategy is applied: Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is used to reduce redundant waypoints in dense regions, while a greedy algorithm ensures complete coverage in sparse areas. To verify the generality of the framework, we solve the resulting TSP using three different methods: Greedy Heuristic Insertion (GHI), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Monte Carlo Reinforcement Learning (MCRL). Then an object-based optimization is applied to further refine the resulting path. Additionally, CPP-DIP integrates ForaNav, our insect-inspired navigation method, for accurate tree localization and tracking. The experimental results show that MCRL offers a balanced solution, reducing the travel distance by 16.9 % compared to ACO while maintaining a similar performance to GHI. It also improves path smoothness by reducing turning angles by 28.3 % and 59.9 % relative to ACO and GHI, respectively, and effectively eliminates intersections. These results confirm the robustness and effectiveness of CPP-DIP in different TSP solvers.</p></details>|
|**2025-05-08**|**A Vehicle System for Navigating Among Vulnerable Road Users Including Remote Operation**|Oscar de Groot et.al.|[2505.04982](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04982)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a vehicle system capable of navigating safely and efficiently around Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and cyclists. The system comprises key modules for environment perception, localization and mapping, motion planning, and control, integrated into a prototype vehicle. A key innovation is a motion planner based on Topology-driven Model Predictive Control (T-MPC). The guidance layer generates multiple trajectories in parallel, each representing a distinct strategy for obstacle avoidance or non-passing. The underlying trajectory optimization constrains the joint probability of collision with VRUs under generic uncertainties. To address extraordinary situations ("edge cases") that go beyond the autonomous capabilities - such as construction zones or encounters with emergency responders - the system includes an option for remote human operation, supported by visual and haptic guidance. In simulation, our motion planner outperforms three baseline approaches in terms of safety and efficiency. We also demonstrate the full system in prototype vehicle tests on a closed track, both in autonomous and remotely operated modes.</p></details>|

LVLMs excel at high-level task planning across diverse driving scenarios. However, since these foundation models are not specifically designed for driving and their reasoning is not consistent with the feasibility of low-level motion planning, concerns remain regarding safety and smooth task switching. This paper integrates LVLMs with MPC Builder, which automatically generates MPCs on demand, based on symbolic task commands generated by the LVLM, while ensuring optimality and safety. The generated MPCs can strongly assist the execution or rejection of LVLM-driven task switching by providing feedback on the feasibility of the given tasks and generating task-switching-aware MPCs. Our approach provides a safe, flexible, and adaptable control framework, bridging the gap between cutting-edge foundation models and reliable vehicle operation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a simulation experiment, showing that our system can safely and effectively handle highway driving while maintaining the flexibility and adaptability of LVLMs.</p></details>|
|**2025-05-08**|**ReAlign: Bilingual Text-to-Motion Generation via Step-Aware Reward-Guided Alignment**|Wanjiang Weng et.al.|[2505.04974](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04974)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Bilingual text-to-motion generation, which synthesizes 3D human motions from bilingual text inputs, holds immense potential for cross-linguistic applications in gaming, film, and robotics. However, this task faces critical challenges: the absence of bilingual motion-language datasets and the misalignment between text and motion distributions in diffusion models, leading to semantically inconsistent or low-quality motions. To address these challenges, we propose BiHumanML3D, a novel bilingual human motion dataset, which establishes a crucial benchmark for bilingual text-to-motion generation models. Furthermore, we propose a Bilingual Motion Diffusion model (BiMD), which leverages cross-lingual aligned representations to capture semantics, thereby achieving a unified bilingual model. Building upon this, we propose Reward-guided sampling Alignment (ReAlign) method, comprising a step-aware reward model to assess alignment quality during sampling and a reward-guided strategy that directs the diffusion process toward an optimally aligned distribution. This reward model integrates step-aware tokens and combines a text-aligned module for semantic consistency and a motion-aligned module for realism, refining noisy motions at each timestep to balance probability density and alignment. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves text-motion alignment and motion quality compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

|**2025-05-08**|**Real-Time Model Predictive Control of Vehicles with Convex-Polygon-Aware Collision Avoidance in Tight Spaces**|Haruki Kojima et.al.|[2505.04935](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04935)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper proposes vehicle motion planning methods with obstacle avoidance in tight spaces by incorporating polygonal approximations of both the vehicle and obstacles into a model predictive control (MPC) framework. Representing these shapes is crucial for navigation in tight spaces to ensure accurate collision detection. However, incorporating polygonal approximations leads to disjunctive OR constraints in the MPC formulation, which require a mixed integer programming and cause significant computational cost. To overcome this, we propose two different collision-avoidance constraints that reformulate the disjunctive OR constraints as tractable conjunctive AND constraints: (1) a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based formulation that recasts collision avoidance as a SVM optimization problem, and (2) a Minimum Signed Distance to Edges (MSDE) formulation that leverages minimum signed-distance metrics. We validate both methods through extensive simulations, including tight-space parking scenarios and varied-shape obstacle courses, as well as hardware experiments on an RC-car platform. Our results demonstrate that the SVM-based approach achieves superior navigation accuracy in constrained environments; the MSDE approach, by contrast, runs in real time with only a modest reduction in collision-avoidance performance.</p></details>|

However, as a primary task of coverage path planning (CPP) for troweling, delimitating area of interest (AOI) in complex scenes is still challenging, especially for swing-arm robots with more complex working modes. Thus, this research proposes an algorithm to delimitate AOI for swing-arm troweling robot (SatAOI algorithm). By analyzing characteristics of the robot and obstacle maps, mathematical models and collision principles are established. On this basis, SatAOI algorithm achieves AOI delimitation by global search and collision detection. Experiments on different obstacle maps indicate that AOI can be effectively delimitated in scenes under different complexity, and the algorithm can fully consider the connectivity of obstacle maps. This research serves as a foundation for CPP algorithm and full process simulation of swing-arm troweling robots.</p></details>|

The wide diversity of items and strict business requirements for high producing rates and low defect generation have prohibited warehouse robotics from performing this task. Our innovations in hardware, perception, decision-making, motion planning, and control have enabled this system to perform over 500,000 stows in a large e-commerce fulfillment center. The system achieves human levels of packing density and speed while prioritizing work on overhead shelves to enhance the safety of humans working alongside the robots.</p></details>|
|**2025-05-07**|**Mastering Multi-Drone Volleyball through Hierarchical Co-Self-Play Reinforcement Learning**|Ruize Zhang et.al.|[2505.04317](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04317)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we tackle the problem of learning to play 3v3 multi-drone volleyball, a new embodied competitive task that requires both high-level strategic coordination and low-level agile control. The task is turn-based, multi-agent, and physically grounded, posing significant challenges due to its long-horizon dependencies, tight inter-agent coupling, and the underactuated dynamics of quadrotors. To address this, we propose Hierarchical Co-Self-Play (HCSP), a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that separates centralized high-level strategic decision-making from decentralized low-level motion control. We design a three-stage population-based training pipeline to enable both strategy and skill to emerge from scratch without expert demonstrations: (I) training diverse low-level skills, (II) learning high-level strategy via self-play with fixed low-level controllers, and (III) joint fine-tuning through co-self-play. Experiments show that HCSP achieves superior performance, outperforming non-hierarchical self-play and rule-based hierarchical baselines with an average 82.9\% win rate and a 71.5\% win rate against the two-stage variant. Moreover, co-self-play leads to emergent team behaviors such as role switching and coordinated formations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our hierarchical design and training scheme.</p></details>|
|**2025-05-02**|**GENMO: A GENeralist Model for Human MOtion**|Jiefeng Li et.al.|[2505.01425](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01425)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Human motion modeling traditionally separates motion generation and estimation into distinct tasks with specialized models. Motion generation models focus on creating diverse, realistic motions from inputs like text, audio, or keyframes, while motion estimation models aim to reconstruct accurate motion trajectories from observations like videos. Despite sharing underlying representations of temporal dynamics and kinematics, this separation limits knowledge transfer between tasks and requires maintaining separate models. We present GENMO, a unified Generalist Model for Human Motion that bridges motion estimation and generation in a single framework. Our key insight is to reformulate motion estimation as constrained motion generation, where the output motion must precisely satisfy observed conditioning signals. Leveraging the synergy between regression and diffusion, GENMO achieves accurate global motion estimation while enabling diverse motion generation. We also introduce an estimation-guided training objective that exploits in-the-wild videos with 2D annotations and text descriptions to enhance generative diversity. Furthermore, our novel architecture handles variable-length motions and mixed multimodal conditions (text, audio, video) at different time intervals, offering flexible control. This unified approach creates synergistic benefits: generative priors improve estimated motions under challenging conditions like occlusions, while diverse video data enhances generation capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate GENMO's effectiveness as a generalist framework that successfully handles multiple human motion tasks within a single model.</p></details>|
|**2025-05-02**|**Dynamic Robot Tool Use with Vision Language Models**|Noah Trupin et.al.|[2505.01399](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01399)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Tool use enhances a robot's task capabilities. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have equipped robots with sophisticated cognitive capabilities for tool-use applications. However, existing methodologies focus on elementary quasi-static tool manipulations or high-level tool selection while neglecting the critical aspect of task-appropriate tool grasping. To address this limitation, we introduce inverse Tool-Use Planning (iTUP), a novel VLM-driven framework that enables grounded fine-grained planning for versatile robotic tool use. Through an integrated pipeline of VLM-based tool and contact point grounding, position-velocity trajectory planning, and physics-informed grasp generation and selection, iTUP demonstrates versatility across (1) quasi-static and more challenging (2) dynamic and (3) cluster tool-use tasks. To ensure robust planning, our framework integrates stable and safe task-aware grasping by reasoning over semantic affordances and physical constraints. We evaluate iTUP and baselines on a comprehensive range of realistic tool use tasks including precision hammering, object scooping, and cluster sweeping. Experimental results demonstrate that iTUP ensures a thorough grounding of cognition and planning for challenging robot tool use across diverse environments.</p></details>|

However, human motions commonly occur within diverse 3D scenes, which has prompted exploration into scene-aware text-to-motion generation methods. Yet, existing scene-aware methods often rely on large-scale ground-truth motion sequences in diverse 3D scenes, which poses practical challenges due to the expensive cost. To mitigate this challenge, we are the first to propose a \textbf{T}raining-free \textbf{S}cene-aware \textbf{T}ext-to-\textbf{Motion} framework, dubbed as \textbf{TSTMotion}, that efficiently empowers pre-trained blank-background motion generators with the scene-aware capability. Specifically, conditioned on the given 3D scene and text description, we adopt foundation models together to reason, predict and validate a scene-aware motion guidance. Then, the motion guidance is incorporated into the blank-background motion generators with two modifications, resulting in scene-aware text-driven motion sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of our proposed framework. We release our code in \href{https://tstmotion.github.io/}{Project Page}.</p></details>|

This algorithm extracts a subset of the residuals of input points such that the subset yields exactly the same quadratic error function as that of the original set for a given pose. This enables a significant reduction in the number of residuals to be evaluated without approximation errors at the sampling point. Using this algorithm, we devise a complete SLAM framework that consists of odometry estimation based on sliding window optimization and global trajectory optimization based on registration error minimization over the entire map, both of which can run in real time on a standard CPU. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art CPU-based SLAM frameworks without the use of GPU acceleration.</p></details>|

Recent score-based generative models (SGMs) have demonstrated impressive results on this task. However, their training process involves complex curvature trajectories, leading to unstable training process. In this paper, we propose a Deterministic-to-Stochastic Diverse Latent Feature Mapping (DSDFM) method for human motion synthesis. DSDFM consists of two stages. The first human motion reconstruction stage aims to learn the latent space distribution of human motions. The second diverse motion generation stage aims to build connections between the Gaussian distribution and the latent space distribution of human motions, thereby enhancing the diversity and accuracy of the generated human motions. This stage is achieved by the designed deterministic feature mapping procedure with DerODE and stochastic diverse output generation procedure with DivSDE.DSDFM is easy to train compared to previous SGMs-based methods and can enhance diversity without introducing additional training parameters.Through qualitative and quantitative experiments, DSDFM achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing the latest methods, validating its superiority in human motion synthesis.</p></details>|

Pham et.al.|[2505.00831](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00831)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Efficient path planning in robotics, particularly within large-scale, dynamic environments, remains a significant hurdle. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, their high computational cost and limited adaptability in dynamic scenarios hinder real-time deployment on edge devices. We present SmallPlan -- a novel framework leveraging LLMs as teacher models to train lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) for high-level path planning tasks. In SmallPlan, the SLMs provide optimal action sequences to navigate across scene graphs that compactly represent full-scaled 3D scenes. The SLMs are trained in a simulation-powered, interleaved manner with LLM-guided supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). This strategy not only enables SLMs to successfully complete navigation tasks but also makes them aware of important factors like travel distance and number of trials. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the fine-tuned SLMs perform competitively with larger models like GPT-4o on sequential path planning, without suffering from hallucination and overfitting. SmallPlan is resource-efficient, making it well-suited for edge-device deployment and advancing practical autonomous robotics.</p></details>|

Chumley et.al.|[2505.00782](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00782)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Nonlinear dynamical systems are complex and typically only simple systems can be analytically studied. In applications, these systems are usually defined with a set of tunable parameters and as the parameters are varied the system response undergoes significant topological changes or bifurcations. In a high dimensional parameter space, it is difficult to determine which direction to vary the system parameters to achieve a desired system response or state. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for optimally navigating a dynamical system parameter space that is rooted in topological data analysis. Specifically we use the differentiability of persistence diagrams to define a topological language for intuitively promoting or deterring different topological features in the state space response of a dynamical system and use gradient descent to optimally move from one point in the parameter space to another. The end result is a path in this space that guides the system to a set of parameters that yield the desired topological features defined by the loss function. We show a number of examples by applying the methods to different dynamical systems and scenarios to demonstrate how to promote different features and how to choose the hyperparameters to achieve different outcomes.</p></details>|

Intersections offer strong landmarks to correct vehicle pose estimation in GNSS dropouts and anchor new sensor data in up-to-date maps. They are also decisive routing nodes in road network graphs. Despite that importance, intersection localization has not been widely studied, with existing methods either ignore the rich semantic information already computed onboard or depend on scarce, hand-labeled intersection datasets. To close that gap, this paper presents a LiDAR-based method for online vehicle-centric intersection localization. We fuse semantic road segmentation with vehicle local pose to detect intersection candidates in a bird's eye view (BEV) representation. We then refine those candidates by analyzing branch topology and correcting the intersection point in a least squares formulation. To evaluate our method, we introduce an automated benchmarking pipeline that pairs localized intersection points with OpenStreetMap (OSM) intersection nodes using precise GNSS/INS ground-truth poses. Experiments on SemanticKITTI show that the method outperforms the latest learning-based baseline in accuracy and reliability. Moreover, sensitivity tests demonstrate that our method is robust to challenging segmentation error levels, highlighting its applicability in the real world.</p></details>|

The approach consists of two key steps: one-shot multimodal motion prediction to anticipate motions of dynamic obstacles and model predictive control to incorporate these predictions into the motion planning process. Motion prediction is driven by an energy-based neural network that generates high-resolution, multi-step predictions in a single operation. The prediction outcomes are further utilized to create geometric shapes formulated as mathematical constraints. Instead of treating each dynamic obstacle individually, predicted obstacles are grouped by proximity in an unsupervised way to improve performance and efficiency. The overall collision-free navigation is handled by model predictive control with a specific design for proactive dynamic obstacle avoidance. The proposed approach allows mobile robots to navigate effectively in dynamic environments. Its performance is accessed across various scenarios that represent typical warehouse settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other existing dynamic obstacle avoidance methods.</p></details>|

The proposed method includes innovations in three aspects: 1) the pre-processing of point cloud maps with a multi-level skip-list structure and data-slimming algorithm for well-organized and simplified map formalization and management, 2) the direct acquisition of local traversability indexes through vehicle and point cloud interaction analysis, which saves work in surface fitting, and 3) the assignment of traversability indexes on a multi-level connectivity graph to generate a weighted traversability graph for generally search-based path planning. The A* algorithm is modified to utilize the traversability graph to generate a short and safe path. The effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method are verified through indoor and outdoor experiments conducted in various environments, including multi-floor buildings, woodland, and rugged mountainous regions.

Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from $63\%$ to $95\%$. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from $59\%$ to $92\%$ , significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, little to no reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of image quality or diversity, and both remained stable in our experiments.</p></details>|

While supervised learning remains the standard method, reinforcement learning (RL) offers unique advantages through its sequential decision-making framework, which naturally fits the iterative nature of data assimilation by dynamically balancing model forecasts with observations. We develop RL-DAUNCE, a new RL-based method that enhances data assimilation with physical constraints through three key aspects. First, RL-DAUNCE inherits the computational efficiency of machine learning while it uniquely structures its agents to mirror ensemble members in conventional data assimilation methods. Second, RL-DAUNCE emphasizes uncertainty quantification by advancing multiple ensemble members, moving beyond simple mean-state optimization. Third, RL-DAUNCE's ensemble-as-agents design facilitates the enforcement of physical constraints during the assimilation process, which is crucial to improving the state estimation and subsequent forecasting. A primal-dual optimization strategy is developed to enforce constraints, which dynamically penalizes the reward function to ensure constraint satisfaction throughout the learning process. Also, state variable bounds are respected by constraining the RL action space. Together, these features ensure physical consistency without sacrificing efficiency. RL-DAUNCE is applied to the Madden-Julian Oscillation, an intermittent atmospheric phenomenon characterized by strongly non-Gaussian features and multiple physical constraints. RL-DAUNCE outperforms the standard ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), which fails catastrophically due to the violation of physical constraints. Notably, RL-DAUNCE matches the performance of constrained EnKF, particularly in recovering intermittent signals, capturing extreme events, and quantifying uncertainties, while requiring substantially less computational effort.</p></details>|

However, the effectiveness of such monitoring hinges on CoTs faithfully representing models' actual reasoning processes. We evaluate CoT faithfulness of state-of-the-art reasoning models across 6 reasoning hints presented in the prompts and find: (1) for most settings and models tested, CoTs reveal their usage of hints in at least 1% of examples where they use the hint, but the reveal rate is often below 20%, (2) outcome-based reinforcement learning initially improves faithfulness but plateaus without saturating, and (3) when reinforcement learning increases how frequently hints are used (reward hacking), the propensity to verbalize them does not increase, even without training against a CoT monitor. These results suggest that CoT monitoring is a promising way of noticing undesired behaviors during training and evaluations, but that it is not sufficient to rule them out. They also suggest that in settings like ours where CoT reasoning is not necessary, test-time monitoring of CoTs is unlikely to reliably catch rare and catastrophic unexpected behaviors.</p></details>|

Our goal is to determine a route for a single crew to visit and repair the disruptions to restore service with minimum negative impact. We call this problem the Traveling Repairman Network Restoration Problem (TRNRP). This problem presents strong computational challenges due to the combinatorial nature of the decisions, inter-dependencies within the underlying infrastructure network, and incomplete information. Considering the dynamic nature of the decisions as a result of dynamic information revelation on the status of the nodes, we model this problem as a finite-horizon Markov decision process. Our solution approach uses value approximation based on reinforcement learning, which is strengthened by structural results that identify a set of suboptimal moves. In addition, we propose state aggregation methods to reduce the size of the state space. We perform extensive computational studies to characterize the performance of our solution methods under different parameter settings and to compare them with benchmark solution approaches.</p></details>|

Bimanual robots-which also feature bilateral symmetry-should similarly exploit this property to perform tasks with either hand. Unlike humans, who often favor a dominant hand for fine dexterous skills, robots should ideally execute ambidextrous manipulation with equal proficiency. To this end, we introduce SYMDEX (SYMmetric DEXterity), a reinforcement learning framework for ambidextrous bi-manipulation that leverages the robot's inherent bilateral symmetry as an inductive bias. SYMDEX decomposes complex bimanual manipulation tasks into per-hand subtasks and trains dedicated policies for each. By exploiting bilateral symmetry via equivariant neural networks, experience from one arm is inherently leveraged by the opposite arm. We then distill the subtask policies into a global ambidextrous policy that is independent of the hand-task assignment. We evaluate SYMDEX on six challenging simulated manipulation tasks and demonstrate successful real-world deployment on two of them. Our approach strongly outperforms baselines on complex task in which the left and right hands perform different roles. We further demonstrate SYMDEX's scalability by extending it to a four-arm manipulation setup, where our symmetry-aware policies enable effective multi-arm collaboration and coordination. Our results highlight how structural symmetry as inductive bias in policy learning enhances sample efficiency, robustness, and generalization across diverse dexterous manipulation tasks.</p></details>|

Nevertheless, the paradigm has recently shifted towards multi-task data and multi-task learning (MTL), targeting generalist and foundation models that can handle multiple tasks simultaneously. Despite their growing importance, MTL data and models have been largely neglected while pursuing unlearnable strategies. This paper presents MTL-UE, the first unified framework for generating unlearnable examples for multi-task data and MTL models. Instead of optimizing perturbations for each sample, we design a generator-based structure that introduces label priors and class-wise feature embeddings which leads to much better attacking performance. In addition, MTL-UE incorporates intra-task and inter-task embedding regularization to increase inter-class separation and suppress intra-class variance which enhances the attack robustness greatly. Furthermore, MTL-UE is versatile with good supports for dense prediction tasks in MTL. It is also plug-and-play allowing integrating existing surrogate-dependent unlearnable methods with little adaptation. Extensive experiments show that MTL-UE achieves superior attacking performance consistently across 4 MTL datasets, 3 base UE methods, 5 model backbones, and 5 MTL task-weighting strategies.</p></details>|

This paper addresses key concerns in this domain, focusing on inferring state representations from individual agent observations and leveraging these representations to enhance agents' exploration and collaborative task execution policies. To this end, we propose a novel state modelling framework for cooperative MARL, where agents infer meaningful belief representations of the non-observable state, with respect to optimizing their own policies, while filtering redundant and less informative joint state information. Building upon this framework, we propose the MARL SMPE algorithm. In SMPE, agents enhance their own policy's discriminative abilities under partial observability, explicitly by incorporating their beliefs into the policy network, and implicitly by adopting an adversarial type of exploration policies which encourages agents to discover novel, high-value states while improving the discriminative abilities of others. Experimentally, we show that SMPE outperforms state-of-the-art MARL algorithms in complex fully cooperative tasks from the MPE, LBF, and RWARE benchmarks.</p></details>|

To bridge the digital divide, this paper investigates the potential of leveraging multiple high-altitude platforms (HAPs) for energy-efficient content delivery in wide rural regions. Each caching-enabled HAP is equipped with both Free-Space Optical (FSO) transceivers for backhaul links and Radio Frequency (RF) antenna arrays for access links. To further enhance network efficiency, we consider a network coding-based multicasting scheme, where different types of content are treated as distinct multicast sessions. With the objective of minimizing long-term power cost, we propose a hierarchical framework that integrates deep reinforcement learn-ing (DRL) and convex optimization to jointly optimize dynamic caching strategies and resource allocation across the network. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces power cost compared to several baseline approaches, providing a practical solution for improving rural connectivity.</p></details>|
|**2025-05-08**|**Advancing Neural Network Verification through Hierarchical Safety Abstract Interpretation**|Luca Marzari et.al.|[2505.05235](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05235)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Traditional methods for formal verification (FV) of deep neural networks (DNNs) are constrained by a binary encoding of safety properties, where a model is classified as either safe or unsafe (robust or not robust). This binary encoding fails to capture the nuanced safety levels within a model, often resulting in either overly restrictive or too permissive requirements. In this paper, we introduce a novel problem formulation called Abstract DNN-Verification, which verifies a hierarchical structure of unsafe outputs, providing a more granular analysis of the safety aspect for a given DNN. Crucially, by leveraging abstract interpretation and reasoning about output reachable sets, our approach enables assessing multiple safety levels during the FV process, requiring the same (in the worst case) or even potentially less computational effort than the traditional binary verification approach. Specifically, we demonstrate how this formulation allows rank adversarial inputs according to their abstract safety level violation, offering a more detailed evaluation of the model's safety and robustness. Our contributions include a theoretical exploration of the relationship between our novel abstract safety formulation and existing approaches that employ abstract interpretation for robustness verification, complexity analysis of the novel problem introduced, and an empirical evaluation considering both a complex deep reinforcement learning task (based on Habitat 3.0) and standard DNN-Verification benchmarks.</p></details>|

This paper investigates efficient deployment of FL in wireless heterogeneous networks, focusing on strategies to accelerate convergence despite stragglers. The primary objective is to minimize long-term convergence wall-clock time through optimized user scheduling and resource allocation. While stragglers may introduce delays in a single round, their inclusion can expedite subsequent rounds, particularly when they possess critical information. Moreover, balancing single-round duration with the number of cumulative rounds, compounded by dynamic training and transmission conditions, necessitates a novel approach beyond conventional optimization solutions. To tackle these challenges, convergence analysis with respect to adaptive and biased scheduling is derived. Then, by factoring in real-time system and statistical information, including diverse energy constraints and users' energy harvesting capabilities, a deep reinforcement learning approach, empowered by proximal policy optimization, is employed to adaptively select user sets. For the scheduled users, Lagrangian decomposition is applied to optimize local resource utilization, further enhancing system efficiency. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework for various FL tasks, demonstrating reduced task time compared to existing benchmarks under various settings.</p></details>|

The hardware platform integrates a small camera, a standard airframe, offboard computation, and radio communication for manual overrides. We demonstrate FalconWing's capabilities by developing and deploying a purely vision-based control policy for autonomous landing (without IMU or motion capture) using a novel real-to-sim-to-real learning approach. Our learning approach: (1) constructs a photorealistic simulation environment via 3D Gaussian splatting trained on real-world images; (2) identifies nonlinear dynamics from vision-estimated real-flight data; and (3) trains a multi-modal Vision Transformer (ViT) policy through simulation-only imitation learning. The ViT architecture fuses single RGB image with the history of control actions via self-attention, preserving temporal context while maintaining real-time 20 Hz inference. When deployed zero-shot on the hardware platform, this policy achieves an 80% success rate in vision-based autonomous landings. Together with the hardware specifications, we also open-source the system dynamics, the software for photorealistic simulator and the learning approach.</p></details>|

For nearly forty years, TD learning has served as a workhorse for applied RL as well as a building block for more complex and specialized algorithms. However, despite its widespread use, it is not without drawbacks, the most prominent being its sensitivity to step size. A poor choice of step size can dramatically inflate the error of value estimates and slow convergence. Consequently, in practice, researchers must use trial and error in order to identify a suitable step size -- a process that can be tedious and time consuming. As an alternative, we propose implicit TD algorithms that reformulate TD updates into fixed-point equations. These updates are more stable and less sensitive to step size without sacrificing computational efficiency. Moreover, our theoretical analysis establishes asymptotic convergence guarantees and finite-time error bounds. Our results demonstrate their robustness and practicality for modern RL tasks, establishing implicit TD as a versatile tool for policy evaluation and value approximation.</p></details>|

In this paradigm, $N$ identical agents operate in $N$ replicas of an environment simulator, accelerating data collection by a factor of $N$. A critical question arises: \textit{Does specializing the policies of the parallel agents hold the key to surpass the $N$ factor acceleration?} In this paper, we introduce a novel learning framework that maximizes the entropy of collected data in a parallel setting. Our approach carefully balances the entropy of individual agents with inter-agent diversity, effectively minimizing redundancies. The latter idea is implemented with a centralized policy gradient method, which shows promise when evaluated empirically against systems of identical agents, as well as synergy with batch RL techniques that can exploit data diversity. Finally, we provide an original concentration analysis that shows faster rates for specialized parallel sampling distributions, which supports our methodology and may be of independent interest.</p></details>|

By enabling intelligent control and optimization of household energy consumption, HEMS plays a significant role in bridging the gap between consumer needs and energy utility objectives. However, much of the existing literature construes consumer comfort as a mere deviation from the standard appliance settings. Such deviations are typically incorporated into optimization objectives via static weighting factors. These factors often overlook the dynamic nature of consumer behaviors and preferences. Addressing this oversight, our paper introduces a multi-mode Deep Reinforcement Learning-based HEMS (DRL-HEMS) framework, meticulously designed to optimize based on dynamic, consumer-defined preferences. Our primary goal is to augment consumer involvement in Demand Response (DR) programs by embedding dynamic multi-mode preferences tailored to individual appliances. In this study, we leverage a model-free, single-agent DRL algorithm to deliver a HEMS framework that is not only dynamic but also user-friendly. To validate its efficacy, we employed real-world data at 15-minute intervals, including metrics such as electricity price, ambient temperature, and appliances' power consumption. Our results show that the model performs exceptionally well in optimizing energy consumption within different preference modes. Furthermore, when compared to traditional algorithms based on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), our model achieves nearly optimal performance while outperforming in computational efficiency.</p></details>|

In contrast, humans are able to learn efficiently by watching others interact with their environment. To bridge this gap, we introduce semantic action flow as a core intermediate representation capturing the essential spatio-temporal manipulator-object interactions, invariant to superficial visual differences. We present ViSA-Flow, a framework that learns this representation self-supervised from unlabeled large-scale video data. First, a generative model is pre-trained on semantic action flows automatically extracted from large-scale human-object interaction video data, learning a robust prior over manipulation structure. Second, this prior is efficiently adapted to a target robot by fine-tuning on a small set of robot demonstrations processed through the same semantic abstraction pipeline. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on the CALVIN benchmark and real-world tasks that ViSA-Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in low-data regimes, outperforming prior methods by effectively transferring knowledge from human video observation to robotic execution.

These efforts are informed by scientific reports, which rely in part on Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), prominent tools used to assess the economic impacts of climate policies. However, traditional IAMs optimize policies based on a single objective, limiting their ability to capture the trade-offs among economic growth, temperature goals, and climate justice. As a result, policy recommendations have been criticized for perpetuating inequalities, fueling disagreements during policy negotiations. We introduce Justice, the first framework integrating IAM with Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MOMARL). By incorporating multiple objectives, Justice generates policy recommendations that shed light on equity while balancing climate and economic goals. Further, using multiple agents can provide a realistic representation of the interactions among the diverse policy actors. We identify equitable Pareto-optimal policies using our framework, which facilitates deliberative decision-making by presenting policymakers with the inherent trade-offs in climate and economic policy.</p></details>|

This foundational review presents a comprehensive synthesis of recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action models, systematically organized across five thematic pillars that structure the landscape of this rapidly evolving field. We begin by establishing the conceptual foundations of VLA systems, tracing their evolution from cross-modal learning architectures to generalist agents that tightly integrate vision-language models (VLMs), action planners, and hierarchical controllers. Our methodology adopts a rigorous literature review framework, covering over 80 VLA models published in the past three years. Key progress areas include architectural innovations, parameter-efficient training strategies, and real-time inference accelerations. We explore diverse application domains such as humanoid robotics, autonomous vehicles, medical and industrial robotics, precision agriculture, and augmented reality navigation. The review further addresses major challenges across real-time control, multimodal action representation, system scalability, generalization to unseen tasks, and ethical deployment risks. Drawing from the state-of-the-art, we propose targeted solutions including agentic AI adaptation, cross-embodiment generalization, and unified neuro-symbolic planning. In our forward-looking discussion, we outline a future roadmap where VLA models, VLMs, and agentic AI converge to power socially aligned, adaptive, and general-purpose embodied agents. This work serves as a foundational reference for advancing intelligent, real-world robotics and artificial general intelligence. >Vision-language-action, Agentic AI, AI Agents, Vision-language Models</p></details>|

However, current robotic systems face significant limitations, such as limited cross-embodiment adaptability, inefficient task scheduling, and insufficient dynamic error correction. While End-to-end VLA models demonstrate inadequate long-horizon planning and task generalization, hierarchical VLA models suffer from a lack of cross-embodiment and multi-agent coordination capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce RoboOS, the first open-source embodied system built on a Brain-Cerebellum hierarchical architecture, enabling a paradigm shift from single-agent to multi-agent intelligence. Specifically, RoboOS consists of three key components: (1) Embodied Brain Model (RoboBrain), a MLLM designed for global perception and high-level decision-making; (2) Cerebellum Skill Library, a modular, plug-and-play toolkit that facilitates seamless execution of multiple skills; and (3) Real-Time Shared Memory, a spatiotemporal synchronization mechanism for coordinating multi-agent states. By integrating hierarchical information flow, RoboOS bridges Embodied Brain and Cerebellum Skill Library, facilitating robust planning, scheduling, and error correction for long-horizon tasks, while ensuring efficient multi-agent collaboration through Real-Time Shared Memory. Furthermore, we enhance edge-cloud communication and cloud-based distributed inference to facilitate high-frequency interactions and enable scalable deployment. Extensive real-world experiments across various scenarios, demonstrate RoboOS's versatility in supporting heterogeneous embodiments. Project website: https://github.com/FlagOpen/RoboOS</p></details>|

For instance, VLAs might successfully put the cream cheese in the bowl and put the bowl on top of the cabinet, yet still fail to put the cream cheese on top of the cabinet. In this work, we demonstrate that behaviors from distinct tasks can be effectively recombined by manipulating the VLA's internal representations at inference time. Concretely, we identify the text latent by averaging the text tokens' hidden states across all demonstrated trajectories for a specific base task. For executing an extrapolated task, we can temporally interpolate the text latent of the two base tasks and add it back to the text hidden states, so sub-behaviors from the two tasks will be activated sequentially. We evaluate this approach using the newly created libero-ood benchmark, featuring 20 tasks extrapolated from standard LIBERO suites. The results on libero-ood show that all SOTA VLAs achieve < 15% success rate, while $\pi0$ with text latent interpolation reaches an 83% success rate. Further qualitative analysis reveals a tendency for VLAs to exhibit spatial overfitting, mapping object names to demonstrated locations rather than achieving genuine object and goal understanding. Additionally, we find that decoding the text latent yields human-unreadable prompts that can nevertheless instruct the VLA to achieve a 70% success rate on standard LIBERO suites, enabling private instruction or backdoor attacks.</p></details>|

However, existing models rely heavily on real-world data, which is costly and labor-intensive to collect. Synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative, yet its potential remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we explore the feasibility of training Vision-Language-Action models entirely with large-scale synthetic action data. We curate SynGrasp-1B, a billion-frame robotic grasping dataset generated in simulation with photorealistic rendering and extensive domain randomization. Building on this, we present GraspVLA, a VLA model pretrained on large-scale synthetic action data as a foundational model for grasping tasks. GraspVLA integrates autoregressive perception tasks and flow-matching-based action generation into a unified Chain-of-Thought process, enabling joint training on synthetic action data and Internet semantics data. This design helps mitigate sim-to-real gaps and facilitates the transfer of learned actions to a broader range of Internet-covered objects, achieving open-vocabulary generalization in grasping. Extensive evaluations across real-world and simulation benchmarks demonstrate GraspVLA's advanced zero-shot generalizability and few-shot adaptability to specific human preferences. We will release SynGrasp-1B dataset and pre-trained weights to benefit the community.</p></details>|

This paper explores the potential of using mobile application Global Positioning System (GPS) references and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically generate large volumes of IA commands and responses without having a human generate or retroactively tag the data. In our pilot data collection, by driving to various destinations and collecting voice instructions from GPS applications, we demonstrate a means to collect and categorize the diverse sets of instructions, further accompanied by video data to form complete vision-language-action triads. We provide details on our completely automated data collection prototype system, ADVLAT-Engine. We characterize collected GPS voice instructions into eight different classifications, highlighting the breadth of commands and referentialities available for curation from freely available mobile applications. Through research and exploration into the automation of IA data pairs using GPS references, the potential to increase the speed and volume at which high-quality IA datasets are created, while minimizing cost, can pave the way for robust vision-language-action (VLA) models to serve tasks in vision-language navigation (VLN) and human-interactive autonomous systems.</p></details>|
|**2025-05-06**|**FAST Reveals the Extended HI Halo and Accretion Signatures of NGC2683**|Qian Jiao et.al.|[2505.03158](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03158)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present the results of our recent HI observations conducted on the edge-on galaxy NGC2683 using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). In comparison to previous observations made by the VLA, FAST has detected a more extensive distribution of HI. Particularly noteworthy is that the detections made by FAST extend approximately four times farther than those of the VLA in the vertical direction from the galactic plane. The total HI flux measured for NGC2683 amounts to $F_{\rm HI} = 112.1\,\rm{Jy\,km\,s^{-1}}$ (equivalent to a total HI mass of $M_{\rm HI} = 2.32 \times 10^9\,{\rm M_\odot}$), which is slightly higher than that detected by VLA. FAST has also identified three dwarf galaxies in close proximity to NGC2683, namely KK69, NGC2683dw1 (hereafter dw1), and NGC2683dw3$?$ (hereafter dw3$?$). dw3$?$ is situated within the extended HI distribution of NGC2683 in projection and lies near the tail of KK69 extending towards NGC2683. These observations suggest that dw3$?$ is likely a result of the accretion process from NGC2683 to KK69. Furthermore, FAST has detected three high-velocity clouds (HVCs), with complex B potentially undergoing accretion with NGC2683. Based on the model from Vollmer et al. 2016 and incorporating the HI halo component, we found that the model with the added HI halo aligns more closely with our FAST observations in NGC2683. The estimated mass of this HI halo is $3 \times 10^8\,{\rm M_\odot}$ , constituting approximately 13% of the total HI mass of the galaxy. We suggest that the origination of this HI halo is more likely attributed to external gas accretion.</p></details>|

Samanso et.al.|[2505.02687](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02687)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the effect of the environment on the infrared and radio emission of cluster galaxies during the transition epoch at 1 < z < 2 when they first start to quench consistently in the majority of galaxy clusters. We considered a sample of 129 cluster member galaxies from 11 massive clusters at a confirmed redshift of 1.0-1.8 from the IRAC Shallow Cluster Survey (ISCS), the IRAC Distant Cluster Survey (IDCS), and new 3 GHz images from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). We calculated the IR-radio correlation slope parameter, q, in order to identify differences in the ratios of IR to radio of cluster galaxies and field galaxy comparison samples at different redshifts. Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) were identified and analyzed to search for any effect on the IR-radio correlation. The correlation parameter values were also compared by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with field galaxies. Our comparison of the IR-radio correlation in cluster galaxies to the control sample of field galaxies reveals a marginally to modestly significant difference in the correlation slope parameter at the ~2sigma-3sigma level. A split of the clusters into low-redshift (1 < z < 1.37) and high-redshift (1.37 < z < 1.8) bins indicates a more significant difference in the correlation parameter in the lower redshift cluster subsample, where widespread quenching begins. We find no difference in the IR-radio correlation between galaxies that host AGNs and non-active star-forming galaxies either. This suggests that our AGNs are overwhelmingly radio quiet and therefore do not affect the results we described above. We conclude that further investigations based on larger datasets are needed to constrain the impact of the cluster environment on the IR-radio correlation better.</p></details>|

However, existing models are restricted to robot observations and text-only instructions, lacking the flexibility of interleaved multimodal instructions enabled by recent advances in foundation models in the digital world. In this paper, we present Interleave-VLA, the first framework capable of comprehending interleaved image-text instructions and directly generating continuous action sequences in the physical world. It offers a flexible, model-agnostic paradigm that extends state-of-the-art VLA models with minimal modifications and strong zero-shot generalization. A key challenge in realizing Interleave-VLA is the absence of large-scale interleaved embodied datasets. To bridge this gap, we develop an automatic pipeline that converts text-only instructions from real-world datasets in Open X-Embodiment into interleaved image-text instructions, resulting in the first large-scale real-world interleaved embodied dataset with 210k episodes. Through comprehensive evaluation on simulation benchmarks and real-robot experiments, we demonstrate that Interleave-VLA offers significant benefits: 1) it improves out-of-domain generalization to unseen objects by 2-3x compared to state-of-the-art baselines, 2) supports flexible task interfaces, and 3) handles diverse user-provided image instructions in a zero-shot manner, such as hand-drawn sketches. We further analyze the factors behind Interleave-VLA's strong zero-shot performance, showing that the interleaved paradigm effectively leverages heterogeneous datasets and diverse instruction images, including those from the Internet, which demonstrates strong potential for scaling up. Our model and dataset will be open-sourced.</p></details>|

These measurements thereby allow us to refine predictions from global MHD models. In this paper, we discuss our recent study of the morphological evolution of a CME-driven shock event that occurred on August 3, 2012. Our analysis used white-light coronagraphic observations from three different vantage points in space (SOHO and STEREO A and B). Obtaining data from these spacecraft, we derived key parameters such as the radius of curvature of the driving flux rope, the shock speed, and the standoff distance from the CMEs' leading edge. A notable feature of this event was the availability of rare Faraday rotation measurements of a group of extragalactic radio sources occulted by the solar corona, which were obtained a few hours before the eruption. These observations from the VLA radio interferometer provide independent information on the integrated product of the line-of-sight magnetic field component and electron density. By modeling the shock standoff distance and using constraints from the Faraday rotation measurements, we achieve a high level of agreement between the fast-mode Mach number predicted by the Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere (MAS) code in its thermodynamic mode and the value deduced from the analysis of the 3D reconstruction of coronagraphic data, provided that appropriate correction factors (f_b = 2.4 and f_n = 0.5) are applied in advance to scale the simulated magnetic field and electron density, respectively. Our results are consistent with previous estimates and provide critical information for fine-tuning future MHD simulations.</p></details>|

Luber et.al.|[2504.20253](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20253)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce and describe the CHILES Continuum \& Polarization (CHILES Con Pol) Survey, a 1000 hour 1.4 GHz wideband full polarization radio continuum deepfield with the Very Large Array (VLA), commensurate with the CHILES HI deepfield. We describe the observational configuration, outline the calibration of the data, and discuss the effect of Radio Frequency Interference on different observing epochs. In addition, we present a novel radio continuum imaging strategy, using well known baseline subtraction techniques in radio spectral data, and discuss the applications to the removal of artifacts from sources far from the field center. Additionally, we discuss the nature of a low-level image-wide offset, the so-called ``negative bowl" and simulate our observations in order that we may both properly understand and correct for this artifact. Using these techniques, we present the first total intensity image of the data which achieves an r.m.s. noise of 1.3 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ with a synthesized beam of 4.5\arcsec x 4.0\arcsec, the most sensitive L-band image ever taken at this resolution. We then place this image into the broader context of 1.4 GHz radio continuum surveys in the literature, in terms of image sensitivity and fidelity, and $\mu$ Jy level source counts and P(D) analysis.</p></details>|

However, a significant challenge arises from the limitations of visual encoding, which can result in failures during tasks such as object grasping. Moreover, these models typically suffer from high computational overhead due to their large sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. While these models excel in reasoning and task planning, the substantial computational overhead they incur makes them impractical for real-time robotic environments, where speed and efficiency are paramount. To address the limitations of existing VLA models, we propose NORA, a 3B-parameter model designed to reduce computational overhead while maintaining strong task performance. NORA adopts the Qwen-2.5-VL-3B multimodal model as its backbone, leveraging its superior visual-semantic understanding to enhance visual reasoning and action grounding. Additionally, our \model{} is trained on 970k real-world robot demonstrations and equipped with the FAST+ tokenizer for efficient action sequence generation. Experimental results demonstrate that NORA outperforms existing large-scale VLA models, achieving better task performance with significantly reduced computational overhead, making it a more practical solution for real-time robotic autonomy.</p></details>|

This implies a significant increase in visibility data volumes, scaling as $\mathcal{O}(Q^{2}B)$ for $Q$ antennas and $B$ short-time integration intervals (or batches), calling for efficient data dimensionality reduction techniques. This paper proposes a new approach to data compression during acquisition, coined modulated rank-one projection (MROP). MROP compresses the $Q\times Q$ batchwise covariance matrix into a smaller number $P$ of random rank-one projections and compresses across time by trading $B$ for a smaller number $M$ of random modulations of the ROP measurement vectors. Firstly, we introduce a dual perspective on the MROP acquisition, which can either be understood as random beamforming, or as a post-correlation compression. Secondly, we analyse the noise statistics of MROPs and demonstrate that the random projections induce a uniform noise level across measurements independently of the visibility-weighting scheme used. Thirdly, we propose a detailed analysis of the memory and computational cost requirements across the data acquisition and image reconstruction stages, with comparison to state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction approaches. Finally, the MROP model is validated in simulation for monochromatic intensity imaging, with comparison to the classical and baseline-dependent averaging (BDA) models, and using the uSARA optimisation algorithm for image formation. An extensive experimental setup is considered, with ground-truth images containing diffuse and faint emission and spanning a wide variety of dynamic ranges, and for a range of $uv$ -coverages corresponding to VLA and MeerKAT observation.</p></details>|

While vision-language-action (VLA) models have demonstrated impressive results for end-to-end robot control, it remains an open question how far such models can generalize in the wild. We describe $\pi_{0.5}$, a new model based on $\pi_{0}$ that uses co-training on heterogeneous tasks to enable broad generalization. $\pi_{0.5}$ \ uses data from multiple robots, high-level semantic prediction, web data, and other sources to enable broadly generalizable real-world robotic manipulation. Our system uses a combination of co-training and hybrid multi-modal examples that combine image observations, language commands, object detections, semantic subtask prediction, and low-level actions. Our experiments show that this kind of knowledge transfer is essential for effective generalization, and we demonstrate for the first time that an end-to-end learning-enabled robotic system can perform long-horizon and dexterous manipulation skills, such as cleaning a kitchen or bedroom, in entirely new homes.</p></details>|

Rodriguez et.al.|[2504.15519](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15519)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using JWST near-infrared data of the inner Orion Nebula, \citet{Pearson_McCaughrean_2023} detected 40 binary systems they proposed to be Jupiter-Mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs) -- although their actual nature is still in debate. Only one of the objects, JuMBO\,24, was detected in the radio continuum. Here, we report on new radio continuum (10 GHz) Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) detections of the radio counterpart to JuMBO\,24, and on an unsuccessful search for 5 GHz continuum emission with the High Sensitivity Array (HSA). From our new VLA detections and adopting a distance to the region, we set an upper limit of $\simeq 6$~km~s$^{-1}$ to the velocity of the radio source in the plane of the sky. This upper limit favors an origin for this source similar to that of stars, that is, from a stationary contracting core. The nature of the radio emission remains uncertain but the lack of strong variability (all VLA observations are consistent with a steady flux of $\sim$50 $\mu$ Jy), of detection on long HSA baseline, and of detectable circular polarization in VLA data do not favor a non-thermal origin.</p></details>|

We use observations from Juno's MicroWave Radiometer (MWR), the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to probe for the first time the depth and impact of weather on Jupiter. We use ammonia, the main source of opacity at radio wavelengths on Jupiter, as the tracer for the weather by fitting ammonia anomalies to the MWR brightness temperature variations. We show that the majority of the weather on Jupiter is confined to regions where the clouds are forming. Both the South Equatorial Belt and the Equatorial Zone have surprisingly shallow weather systems (P < 2 bar), and even in the North Equatorial Belt most of the ammonia variations is above the water condensation level (P ~ 6 bar). This confirms that the water condensation layer plays a crucial role in controlling the dynamics and the weather on Jupiter. However, the shallow nature of the weather cannot explain the deep-seated depletion down to 30 bar that the Juno mission has revealed. We do find three features, however, that extend below the water condensation layer: a vortex in the northern hemisphere reaching down to 30 bar, an ammonia plume down to 20-30 bars, and the signature of precipitation down to 20 bar. This work highlights the interplay of large-scale processes (vortices, plumes) and small-scale processes (storms) are responsible for shaping the atmospheric makeup of Jupiter.</p></details>|

The images of NGC6822 reveal filaments, edge-brightened bubbles, diffuse emission, and a plethora of point sources. By contrast, most of the MIR emission in WLM is point-like, with a small amount of extended emission. Compared to solar metallicity galaxies, the ratio of 7.7 $\mu$m intensity ($I_\nu^{F770W}$), tracing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), to 21 $\mu$m intensity ($I_\nu^{F2100W}$), tracing small, warm dust grain emission, is suppressed in these low-metallicity dwarfs. Using ALMA CO(2-1) observations, we find that detected CO intensity versus $I_\nu^{F770W}$ at ~2 pc resolution in dwarfs follows a similar relationship to that at solar metallicity and lower resolution, while the CO versus $I_\nu^{F2100W}$ relationship in dwarfs lies significantly below that derived from solar metallicity galaxies at lower resolution, suggesting more pronounced destruction of CO molecules at low metallicity. Finally, adding in Local Group L-Band Survey VLA 21 cm HI observations, we find that $I_\nu^{F2100W}$ and $I_\nu^{F770W}$ vs. total gas ratios are suppressed in NGC6822 and WLM compared to solar metallicity galaxies. In agreement with dust models, the level of suppression appears to be at least partly accounted for by the reduced galaxy-averaged dust-to-gas and PAH-to-dust mass ratios in the dwarfs. Remaining differences are likely due to spatial variations in dust model parameters, which should be an exciting direction for future work in local dwarf galaxies.</p></details>|

Studies of LMXBs with luminosities up to roughly 20% of the Eddington limit indicate that these outflows generally do not co-occur, suggesting that disk winds might inhibit jets. However, previous observations of LMXBs accreting near or above the Eddington limit show that jets and winds can potentially coexist. To investigate this phenomenon, we carried out a comprehensive multi-wavelength campaign (using VLA, Chandra/HETG, and NICER) on the near-Eddington neutron-star Z source LMXB GX 13+1. NICER and Chandra/HETG observations tracked GX 13+1 across the entire Z-track during high Eddington rates, detecting substantial resonance absorption features originating from the accretion disk wind in all X-ray spectra, which implies a persistent wind presence. Simultaneous VLA observations captured a variable radio jet, with radio emission notably strong during all flaring branch observations-contrary to typical behavior in Z-sources-and weaker when the source was on the normal branch. Interestingly, no clear correlation was found between the radio emission and the wind features. Analysis of VLA radio light curves and simultaneous Chandra/HETG spectra demonstrates that an ionized disk wind and jet outflow can indeed coexist in GX 13+1, suggesting that their launching mechanisms are not necessarily linked in this system.</p></details>|

A capable household robot should recognize ambiguity and ask relevant clarification questions to infer the user intent accurately, leading to more effective task execution. To study this problem, we introduce the Ask-to-Act task, where an embodied agent must fetch a specific object instance given an ambiguous instruction in a home environment. The agent must strategically ask minimal, yet relevant, clarification questions to resolve ambiguity while navigating under partial observability. To solve this problem, we propose a novel approach that fine-tunes multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as vision-language-action (VLA) policies using online reinforcement learning (RL) with LLM-generated rewards. Our method eliminates the need for large-scale human demonstrations or manually engineered rewards for training such agents. We benchmark against strong zero-shot baselines, including GPT-4o, and supervised fine-tuned MLLMs, on our task. Our results demonstrate that our RL-finetuned MLLM outperforms all baselines by a significant margin ( $19.1$-$40.3\%$ ), generalizing well to novel scenes and tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of adapting MLLMs as VLA agents that can act and ask for help using LLM-generated rewards with online RL.</p></details>|

Udomworarat et.al.|[2505.05407](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05407)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Problems related to Perron-Frobenius operators (or transfer operators) have been extensively studied and applied across various fields. In this work, we propose neural network methods for approximating solutions to problems involving these operators. Specifically, we focus on computing the power series of non-expansive Perron-Frobenius operators under a given $L^p$-norm with a constant damping parameter in $(0,1)$ . We use PINNs and RVPINNs to approximate solutions in their strong and variational forms, respectively. We provide a priori error estimates for quasi-minimizers of the associated loss functions. We present some numerical results for 1D and 2D examples to show the performance of our methods.</p></details>|

First-arrival traveltime simulation relies on solving the eikonal equation. The accuracy of conventional numerical solvers is limited to a finite-difference approximation. In recent years, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been applied to achieve this task. However, traditional PINNs encounter challenges in accurately solving the eikonal equation, especially in cases where the model exhibits directional scaling differences. These challenges result in substantial traveltime prediction errors when the traveling distance is long. To improve the accuracy of PINN in traveltime prediction, we incorporate the reciprocity principle as a constraint into the PINN training framework. Based on the reciprocity principle, which states that the traveltime between two points remains invariant when their roles as source and receiver are exchanged, we propose to apply this principle to multiple source-receiver pairs in PINN-based traveltime prediction. Furthermore, a dynamic weighting mechanism is proposed to balance the contributions of the eikonal equation loss and the reciprocity-constrained loss during the training process. This adaptive weighting evolves dynamically with the training epochs, enhancing the convergency of the training process. Experiments conducted on a simple lens velocity model, the Overthrust velocity model, and a 3D velocity model demonstrate that the introduction of the reciprocity-constrained PINN significantly improves the accuracy of traveltime predictions.</p></details>|

Parameterized governing equations of the system are used in tandem with the measurements to regularize the regression problem. However, in real-world solution reconstruction problems, the parameterized governing equation may be inconsistent with the physical phenomena that give rise to the measurement data. We show that due to assuming consistency between the true and parameterized physics, PINNs-based approaches may fail to satisfy three basic criteria of interpretability, robustness, and data consistency. As we argue, these criteria ensure that (i) the quality of the reconstruction can be assessed, (ii) the reconstruction does not depend strongly on the choice of physics loss, and (iii) that in certain situations, the physics parameters can be uniquely recovered. In the context of elasticity and heat transfer, we demonstrate how standard formulations of the physics loss and techniques for constraining the solution to respect the measurement data lead to different ``constraint forces" -- which we define as additional source terms arising from the constraints -- and that these constraint forces can significantly influence the reconstructed solution. To avoid the potentially substantial influence of the choice of physics loss and method of constraint enforcement on the reconstructed solution, we propose the ``explicit constraint force method'' (ECFM) to gain control of the source term introduced by the constraint. We then show that by satisfying the criteria of interpretability, robustness, and data consistency, this approach leads to more predictable and customizable reconstructions from noisy measurement data, even when the parameterization of the missing physics is inconsistent with the measured system.</p></details>|

Keller et.al.|[2505.04865](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04865)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Current, realistic numerical simulations of the solar atmosphere reproduce observations in a statistical sense; they do not replicate observations such as a movie of solar granulation. Inversions on the other hand reproduce observations by design, but the resulting models are often not physically self-consistent. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a new approach to solving the time-dependent radiative hydrodynamics equations and matching observations as boundary conditions. PINNs approximate the solution of the integro-differential equations with a deep neural network. The parameters of this network are determined by minimizing the residuals with respect to the physics equations and the observations. The resulting models are continuous in all dimensions, can zoom into local areas of interest in space and time, and provide information on physical parameters that are not necessarily directly observed such as horizontal velocities. Here we present the first proof of concept of this novel approach, explain the underlying methodology in detail, and provide an outlook to the many applications that PINNs enable.</p></details>|

Instead, the weights appear close to Gaussian distributed random matrices. Although significantly more work is needed to support a robust assessment in this direction, these results suggest that deep-learning and the numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation represent two equivalent, but largely distinct paths to the same physical knowledge. If so, Explainable AI might be an unrealistic target and possibly even an ill-posed one.</p></details>|
|**2025-05-06**|**Physics-informed Neural Networks Enable High Fidelity Shear Wave Viscoelastography across Multiple organs**|Ziying Yin et.al.|[2505.03935](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03935)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Tissue viscoelasticity has been recognized as a crucial biomechanical indicator for disease diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring. Conventional shear wave elastography techniques depend on dispersion analysis and face fundamental limitations in clinical scenarios. Particularly, limited wave propagation data with low signal-to-noise ratios, along with challenges in discriminating between dual dispersion sources stemming from viscoelasticity and finite tissue dimensions, pose great difficulties for extracting dispersion relation. In this study, we introduce SWVE-Net, a framework for shear wave viscoelasticity imaging based on a physics-informed neural network (PINN). SWVE-Net circumvents dispersion analysis by directly incorporating the viscoelasticity wave motion equation into the loss functions of the PINN. Finite element simulations reveal that SWVE-Net quantifies viscosity parameters within a wide range (0.15-1.5 Pa*s), even for samples just a few millimeters in size, where substantial wave reflections and dispersion occur. Ex vivo experiments demonstrate its applicability across various organs, including brain, liver, kidney, and spleen, each with distinct viscoelasticity. In in vivo human trials on breast and skeletal muscle tissues, SWVE-Net reliably assesses viscoelastic properties with standard deviation-to-mean ratios below 15%, highlighting robustness under real-world constraints. SWVE-Net overcomes the core limitations of conventional elastography and enables reliable viscoelastic characterization where traditional methods fall short. It holds promise for applications such as grading hepatic lipid accumulation, detecting myocardial infarction boundaries, and distinguishing malignant from benign tumors.</p></details>|

The accurate assessment of active stress parameters is fundamental for a precise understanding of myocardial function but remains difficult to achieve in a clinical setting, especially when only displacement and strain data from medical imaging modalities are available. This work investigates, through an in-silico study, the application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for inferring active contractility parameters in time-dependent cardiac biomechanical models from these types of imaging data. In particular, by parametrising the sought state and parameter field with two neural networks, respectively, and formulating an energy minimisation problem to search for the optimal network parameters, we are able to reconstruct in various settings active stress fields in the presence of noise and with a high spatial resolution. To this end, we also advance the vanilla PINN learning algorithm with the use of adaptive weighting schemes, ad-hoc regularisation strategies, Fourier features, and suitable network architectures. In addition, we thoroughly analyse the influence of the loss weights in the reconstruction of active stress parameters. Finally, we apply the method to the characterisation of tissue inhomogeneities and detection of fibrotic scars in myocardial tissue. This approach opens a new pathway to significantly improve the diagnosis, treatment planning, and management of heart conditions associated with cardiac fibrosis.</p></details>|

Innovations in deep neural networks (DNNs) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) now provide robust tools to tackle longstanding challenges in light scattering engineering, meta-optics, and nonlinear photonics. This review outlines recent progress in leveraging these computational methodologies to enhance device performance across domains such as dynamic light modulation, antenna design, and nonlinear optical phenomena. We systematically survey advancements in AI-driven forward and inverse design strategies, which bypass conventional trial-and-error approaches by embedding physical laws directly into optimization workflows. Furthermore, the integration of AI accelerates electromagnetic simulations and enables precise modelling of complex optical effects, including topological photonic states and nonlinear interactions. A comparative evaluation of algorithmic frameworks highlights their strengths in balancing computational efficiency, multi-objective optimization, and fabrication feasibility. Challenges such as limited interpretability of AI models and data scarcity for unconventional optical modes are critically addressed. Finally, we emphasize future opportunities in scalable multi-physics modelling, adaptive architectures, and practical deployment of AI-optimized photonic devices. This work underscores the pivotal role of AI in transcending traditional design limitations, thereby propelling the development of next-generation photonic technologies with unprecedented functionality and efficiency.</p></details>|

The Yau-Yau method is a highly versatile framework that transforms nonlinear filtering problems into initial-value problems governed by the Forward Kolmogorov Equation (FKE). Previous researches have shown that the method can be applied to highly nonlinear and high dimensional problems. However, when time-varying coefficients are involved in the system models, developing an implementation of the method with high computational speed and low data storage still presents a challenge. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel numerical algorithm that incorporates physics-informed neural network (PINN) and principal component analysis (PCA) to solve the FKE approximately. Equipped with this algorithm, the Yau-Yau filter can be implemented by an offline stage for the training of a solver for the approximate solution of FKE and an online stage for its execution. Results of three examples indicate that this implementation is accurate, both time-efficient and storage-efficient for online computation, and is superior than existing nonlinear filtering methods such as extended Kalman filter and particle filter. It is capable of applications to practical nonlinear time-variant filtering problems.</p></details>|

Barta et.al.|[2505.02580](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02580)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Velocity, pressure, and temperature are the key variables for understanding thermal convection, and measuring them all is a complex task. In this paper, we demonstrate a method to reconstruct temperature and pressure fields based on given Lagrangian velocity data. A physics-informed neural network (PINN) based on a multilayer perceptron architecture and a periodic sine activation function is used to reconstruct both the temperature and the pressure for two cases of turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (Pr = 6.9, Ra = $10^9$ ). The first dataset is generated with DNS and it includes Lagrangian velocity data of 150000 tracer particles. The second contains a PTV experiment with the same system parameters in a water-filled cubic cell, and we observed about 50000 active particle tracks per time step with the open-source framework proPTV. A realistic temperature and pressure field could be reconstructed in both cases, which underlines the importance of PINNs also in the context of experimental data. In the case of the DNS, the reconstructed temperature and pressure fields show a 90\% correlation over all particles when directly validated against the ground truth. Thus, the proposed method, in combination with particle tracking velocimetry, is able to provide velocity, temperature, and pressure fields in convective flows even in the hard turbulence regime. The PINN used in this paper is compatible with proPTV and is part of an open source project. It is available on request at https://github.com/DLR_AS_BOA/RBC_PINN.</p></details>|

Such problems are of major importance in engineering and sciences as it appears in control theory, fluid and gas dynamics, financial modelling and so on. Solutions of such problems exhibit boundary and/or interior layers, which make them difficult to handle. It has been validated in the literature that standard PINNs have low accuracy and can't handle such problems efficiently. Recently Cao et. al \cite{cao2023physics} proposed a new parameter asymptotic PINNs (PA-PINNs) to solve one-parameter singularly perturbed convection-dominated problems. It was observed that PA-PINNs works better than standard PINNs and gPINNs in terms of accuracy, convergence and stability. In this article, for the first time robustness of PA-PINNs will be validated for solving two-parameter SPPs.</p></details>|

However, existing BSDE-based solvers have empirically been shown to underperform relative to PINNs in the literature. In this paper, we identify the root cause of this performance gap as a discretization bias introduced by the standard Euler-Maruyama (EM) integration scheme applied to short-horizon self-consistency BSDE losses, which shifts the optimization landscape off target. We find that this bias cannot be satisfactorily addressed through finer step sizes or longer self-consistency horizons. To properly handle this issue, we propose a Stratonovich-based BSDE formulation, which we implement with stochastic Heun integration. We show that our proposed approach completely eliminates the bias issues faced by EM integration. Furthermore, our empirical results show that our Heun-based BSDE method consistently outperforms EM-based variants and achieves competitive results with PINNs across multiple high-dimensional benchmarks. Our findings highlight the critical role of integration schemes in BSDE-based PDE solvers, an algorithmic detail that has received little attention thus far in the literature.</p></details>|

Unlike existing deep learning methods for NAH, which are predominantly supervised by large datasets, our approach does not require a training phase and it is physics-informed. The wave propagation field is discretized into sparse regions, a process referred to as field discretization, which includes a series of set of source planes, to address the inverse problem. Our method employs the discretized Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral as the wave propagation model. By incorporating virtual planes, additional constraints are enforced near the actual sound source, improving the reconstruction process. Optimization is carried out using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), where physics-based constraints are integrated into the loss functions to account for both direct (from equivalent source plane to hologram plane) and additional (from virtual planes to hologram plane) wave propagation paths. Additionally, sparsity is enforced on the velocity of the equivalent sources. Our comprehensive validation across various rectangular and violin top plates, covering a wide range of vibrational modes, demonstrates that PINN-SFD consistently outperforms the conventional Compressive-Equivalent Source Method (C-ESM), particularly in terms of reconstruction accuracy for complex vibrational patterns. Significantly, this method demonstrates reduced sensitivity to regularization parameters compared to C-ESM.</p></details>|

The fundamental challenge in CGH is solving the inverse problem of phase retrieval from intensity measurements. Physics-inspired neural networks (PINNs), especially Gerchberg-Saxton-based PINNs (GS-PINNs), have advanced phase retrieval capabilities. However, their performance strongly depends on forward models (FMs) and their hyperparameters (FMHs), limiting generalization, complicating benchmarking, and hindering hardware optimization. We present a systematic sensitivity analysis framework based on Saltelli's extension of Sobol's method to quantify FMH impacts on GS-PINN performance. Our analysis demonstrates that SLM pixel-resolution is the primary factor affecting neural network sensitivity, followed by pixel-pitch, propagation distance, and wavelength. Free space propagation forward models demonstrate superior neural network performance compared to Fourier holography, providing enhanced parameterization and generalization. We introduce a composite evaluation metric combining performance consistency, generalization capability, and hyperparameter perturbation resilience, establishing a unified benchmarking standard across CGH configurations. Our research connects physics-inspired deep learning theory with practical CGH implementations through concrete guidelines for forward model selection, neural network architecture, and performance evaluation. Our contributions advance the development of robust, interpretable, and generalizable neural networks for diverse holographic applications, supporting evidence-based decisions in CGH research and implementation.</p></details>|

Despite being demonstrated the ability to incorporate the physics of laws for versatile applications, PINNs still struggle with the challenging problems which are stiff to be solved and/or have high-frequency components in the solutions, resulting in accuracy and convergence issues. It may not only increase computational costs, but also lead to accuracy loss or solution divergence. In this study, an alternative approach is proposed to mitigate the above-mentioned problems. Inspired by the multi-grid method in CFD community, the underlying idea of the current approach is to efficiently remove different frequency errors via training with different levels of training samples, resulting in a simpler way to improve the training accuracy without spending time in fine-tuning of neural network structures, loss weights as well as hyperparameters. To demonstrate the efficacy of current approach, we first investigate canonical 1D ODE with high-frequency component and 2D convection-diffusion equation with V-cycle training strategy. Finally, the current method is employed for the classical benchmark problem of steady Lid-driven cavity flows at different Reynolds numbers, to investigate the applicability and efficacy for the problem involved multiple modes of high and low frequency. By virtue of various training sequence modes, improvement through predictions lead to 30% to 60% accuracy improvement. We also investigate the synergies between current method and transfer learning techniques for more challenging problems (i.e., higher Re). From the present results, it also revealed that the current framework can produce good predictions even for the case of Re=5000, demonstrating the ability to solve complex high-frequency PDEs.</p></details>|

In axisymmetric tokamak reactors in particular, and under the assumption of toroidal symmetry, this equilibrium can be mathematically modelled using the Grad-Shafranov Equation (GSE). Recent works have demonstrated the potential of using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to model the GSE. Existing studies did not examine realistic scenarios in which a single network generalizes to a variety of boundary conditions. Addressing that limitation, we evaluate a PINN architecture that incorporates boundary points as network inputs. Additionally, we compare PINN model accuracy and inference speeds with a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) model. Finding the PINN model to be the most performant, and accurate in our setting, we use the network verification tool Marabou to perform a range of verification tasks. Although we find some discrepancies between evaluations of the networks natively in PyTorch, compared to via Marabou, we are able to demonstrate useful and practical verification workflows. Our study is the first investigation of verification of such networks.</p></details>|

The estimation accuracy and variation can differ significantly across parameters. For instance, inductance estimations are generally more accurate and stable than inductor resistance in a buck converter. However, these performance differences remain to be analyzed with a more systematic approach otherwise the condition monitoring results can be unreliable. Therefore, this paper analyzes the training loss landscape against multiple parameters of a buck converter to provide a systematic explanation of different performances. If the training loss is high and smooth, the estimated circuit parameter typically is accurate and has low variation. Furthermore, a novel physics-informed neural network (PINN) is proposed, offering faster convergence and lower computation requirements compared to an existing PINN method. The proposed method is validated through simulations, where the loss landscape identifies the unreliable parameter estimations, and the PINN can estimate the remaining parameters.</p></details>|

Traditional methods typically require extensive stress-strain or full-field measurements, which are often difficult to obtain in practical settings. To overcome these challenges, we propose a physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based framework that enables the discovery of constitutive models using only sparse measurement data - such as displacement and reaction force - that can be acquired from a single material test. By integrating PINNs with finite element discretization, the framework reconstructs full-field displacement and identifies the underlying strain energy density from predefined candidates, while ensuring consistency with physical laws. A two-stage training process is employed: the Adam optimizer jointly updates neural network parameters and model coefficients to obtain an initial solution, followed by L-BFGS refinement and sparse regression with l_p regularization to extract a parsimonious constitutive model. Validation on benchmark hyperelastic models demonstrates that the proposed method can accurately recover constitutive laws and displacement fields, even when the input data are limited and noisy. These findings highlight the applicability of the proposed framework to experimental scenarios where measurement data are both scarce and noisy.</p></details>|

We propose \$PINN a novel method of computing global uncertainty in PDEs using a Bayesian framework, by combining local Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks (BPINN) with domain decomposition. The solution continuity across subdomains is obtained by imposing the flux continuity across the interface of neighboring subdomains. To demonstrate the effectiveness of \$PINN, we conduct a series of computational experiments on PDEs in 1D and 2D spatial domains. Although we have adopted conservative PINNs (cPINNs), the method can be seamlessly extended to other domain decomposition techniques. The results infer that the proposed method recovers the global uncertainty by computing the local uncertainty exactly more efficiently as the uncertainty in each subdomain can be computed concurrently. The robustness of \$ PINN is verified by adding uncorrelated random noise to the training data up to 15% and testing for different domain sizes.</p></details>|
