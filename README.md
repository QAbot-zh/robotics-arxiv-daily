|**2025-05-02**|**GENMO: A GENeralist Model for Human MOtion**|Jiefeng Li et.al.|[2505.01425](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01425)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Human motion modeling traditionally separates motion generation and estimation into distinct tasks with specialized models. Motion generation models focus on creating diverse, realistic motions from inputs like text, audio, or keyframes, while motion estimation models aim to reconstruct accurate motion trajectories from observations like videos. Despite sharing underlying representations of temporal dynamics and kinematics, this separation limits knowledge transfer between tasks and requires maintaining separate models. We present GENMO, a unified Generalist Model for Human Motion that bridges motion estimation and generation in a single framework. Our key insight is to reformulate motion estimation as constrained motion generation, where the output motion must precisely satisfy observed conditioning signals. Leveraging the synergy between regression and diffusion, GENMO achieves accurate global motion estimation while enabling diverse motion generation. We also introduce an estimation-guided training objective that exploits in-the-wild videos with 2D annotations and text descriptions to enhance generative diversity. Furthermore, our novel architecture handles variable-length motions and mixed multimodal conditions (text, audio, video) at different time intervals, offering flexible control. This unified approach creates synergistic benefits: generative priors improve estimated motions under challenging conditions like occlusions, while diverse video data enhances generation capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate GENMO's effectiveness as a generalist framework that successfully handles multiple human motion tasks within a single model.</p></details>|

Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have equipped robots with sophisticated cognitive capabilities for tool-use applications. However, existing methodologies focus on elementary quasi-static tool manipulations or high-level tool selection while neglecting the critical aspect of task-appropriate tool grasping. To address this limitation, we introduce inverse Tool-Use Planning (iTUP), a novel VLM-driven framework that enables grounded fine-grained planning for versatile robotic tool use. Through an integrated pipeline of VLM-based tool and contact point grounding, position-velocity trajectory planning, and physics-informed grasp generation and selection, iTUP demonstrates versatility across (1) quasi-static and more challenging (2) dynamic and (3) cluster tool-use tasks. To ensure robust planning, our framework integrates stable and safe task-aware grasping by reasoning over semantic affordances and physical constraints. We evaluate iTUP and baselines on a comprehensive range of realistic tool use tasks including precision hammering, object scooping, and cluster sweeping. Experimental results demonstrate that iTUP ensures a thorough grounding of cognition and planning for challenging robot tool use across diverse environments.</p></details>|

However, human motions commonly occur within diverse 3D scenes, which has prompted exploration into scene-aware text-to-motion generation methods. Yet, existing scene-aware methods often rely on large-scale ground-truth motion sequences in diverse 3D scenes, which poses practical challenges due to the expensive cost. To mitigate this challenge, we are the first to propose a \textbf{T}raining-free \textbf{S}cene-aware \textbf{T}ext-to-\textbf{Motion} framework, dubbed as \textbf{TSTMotion}, that efficiently empowers pre-trained blank-background motion generators with the scene-aware capability. Specifically, conditioned on the given 3D scene and text description, we adopt foundation models together to reason, predict and validate a scene-aware motion guidance. Then, the motion guidance is incorporated into the blank-background motion generators with two modifications, resulting in scene-aware text-driven motion sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of our proposed framework. We release our code in \href{https://tstmotion.github.io/}{Project Page}.</p></details>|

This algorithm extracts a subset of the residuals of input points such that the subset yields exactly the same quadratic error function as that of the original set for a given pose. This enables a significant reduction in the number of residuals to be evaluated without approximation errors at the sampling point. Using this algorithm, we devise a complete SLAM framework that consists of odometry estimation based on sliding window optimization and global trajectory optimization based on registration error minimization over the entire map, both of which can run in real time on a standard CPU. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art CPU-based SLAM frameworks without the use of GPU acceleration.</p></details>|

Recent score-based generative models (SGMs) have demonstrated impressive results on this task. However, their training process involves complex curvature trajectories, leading to unstable training process. In this paper, we propose a Deterministic-to-Stochastic Diverse Latent Feature Mapping (DSDFM) method for human motion synthesis. DSDFM consists of two stages. The first human motion reconstruction stage aims to learn the latent space distribution of human motions. The second diverse motion generation stage aims to build connections between the Gaussian distribution and the latent space distribution of human motions, thereby enhancing the diversity and accuracy of the generated human motions. This stage is achieved by the designed deterministic feature mapping procedure with DerODE and stochastic diverse output generation procedure with DivSDE.DSDFM is easy to train compared to previous SGMs-based methods and can enhance diversity without introducing additional training parameters.Through qualitative and quantitative experiments, DSDFM achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing the latest methods, validating its superiority in human motion synthesis.</p></details>|

The SLMs are trained in a simulation-powered, interleaved manner with LLM-guided supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). This strategy not only enables SLMs to successfully complete navigation tasks but also makes them aware of important factors like travel distance and number of trials. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the fine-tuned SLMs perform competitively with larger models like GPT-4o on sequential path planning, without suffering from hallucination and overfitting. SmallPlan is resource-efficient, making it well-suited for edge-device deployment and advancing practical autonomous robotics.</p></details>|
|**2025-05-01**|**Dynamical System Parameter Path Optimization using Persistent Homology**|Max M. Chumley et.al.|[2505.00782](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00782)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Nonlinear dynamical systems are complex and typically only simple systems can be analytically studied. In applications, these systems are usually defined with a set of tunable parameters and as the parameters are varied the system response undergoes significant topological changes or bifurcations. In a high dimensional parameter space, it is difficult to determine which direction to vary the system parameters to achieve a desired system response or state. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for optimally navigating a dynamical system parameter space that is rooted in topological data analysis. Specifically we use the differentiability of persistence diagrams to define a topological language for intuitively promoting or deterring different topological features in the state space response of a dynamical system and use gradient descent to optimally move from one point in the parameter space to another. The end result is a path in this space that guides the system to a set of parameters that yield the desired topological features defined by the loss function. We show a number of examples by applying the methods to different dynamical systems and scenarios to demonstrate how to promote different features and how to choose the hyperparameters to achieve different outcomes.</p></details>|
|**2025-05-02**|**InterLoc: LiDAR-based Intersection Localization using Road Segmentation with Automated Evaluation Method**|Nguyen Hoang Khoi Tran et.al.|[2505.00512](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00512)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Online localization of road intersections is beneficial for autonomous vehicle localization, mapping and motion planning. Intersections offer strong landmarks to correct vehicle pose estimation in GNSS dropouts and anchor new sensor data in up-to-date maps. They are also decisive routing nodes in road network graphs. Despite that importance, intersection localization has not been widely studied, with existing methods either ignore the rich semantic information already computed onboard or depend on scarce, hand-labeled intersection datasets. To close that gap, this paper presents a LiDAR-based method for online vehicle-centric intersection localization. We fuse semantic road segmentation with vehicle local pose to detect intersection candidates in a bird's eye view (BEV) representation. We then refine those candidates by analyzing branch topology and correcting the intersection point in a least squares formulation. To evaluate our method, we introduce an automated benchmarking pipeline that pairs localized intersection points with OpenStreetMap (OSM) intersection nodes using precise GNSS/INS ground-truth poses. Experiments on SemanticKITTI show that the method outperforms the latest learning-based baseline in accuracy and reliability. Moreover, sensitivity tests demonstrate that our method is robust to challenging segmentation error levels, highlighting its applicability in the real world.</p></details>|

The approach consists of two key steps: one-shot multimodal motion prediction to anticipate motions of dynamic obstacles and model predictive control to incorporate these predictions into the motion planning process. Motion prediction is driven by an energy-based neural network that generates high-resolution, multi-step predictions in a single operation. The prediction outcomes are further utilized to create geometric shapes formulated as mathematical constraints. Instead of treating each dynamic obstacle individually, predicted obstacles are grouped by proximity in an unsupervised way to improve performance and efficiency. The overall collision-free navigation is handled by model predictive control with a specific design for proactive dynamic obstacle avoidance. The proposed approach allows mobile robots to navigate effectively in dynamic environments. Its performance is accessed across various scenarios that represent typical warehouse settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other existing dynamic obstacle avoidance methods.</p></details>|

The proposed method includes innovations in three aspects: 1) the pre-processing of point cloud maps with a multi-level skip-list structure and data-slimming algorithm for well-organized and simplified map formalization and management, 2) the direct acquisition of local traversability indexes through vehicle and point cloud interaction analysis, which saves work in surface fitting, and 3) the assignment of traversability indexes on a multi-level connectivity graph to generate a weighted traversability graph for generally search-based path planning. The A* algorithm is modified to utilize the traversability graph to generate a short and safe path. The effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method are verified through indoor and outdoor experiments conducted in various environments, including multi-floor buildings, woodland, and rugged mountainous regions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can properly address 3D path planning problems for ground vehicles in a wide range of situations.</p></details>|

The hardware platform integrates a small camera, a standard airframe, offboard computation, and radio communication for manual overrides. We demonstrate FalconWing's capabilities by developing and deploying a purely vision-based control policy for autonomous landing (without IMU or motion capture) using a novel real-to-sim-to-real learning approach. Our learning approach: (1) constructs a photorealistic simulation environment via 3D Gaussian splatting trained on real-world images; (2) identifies nonlinear dynamics from vision-estimated real-flight data; and (3) trains a multi-modal Vision Transformer (ViT) policy through simulation-only imitation learning. The ViT architecture fuses single RGB image with the history of control actions via self-attention, preserving temporal context while maintaining real-time 20 Hz inference. When deployed zero-shot on the hardware platform, this policy achieves an 80% success rate in vision-based autonomous landings. Together with the hardware specifications, we also open-source the system dynamics, the software for photorealistic simulator and the learning approach.</p></details>|

For nearly forty years, TD learning has served as a workhorse for applied RL as well as a building block for more complex and specialized algorithms. However, despite its widespread use, it is not without drawbacks, the most prominent being its sensitivity to step size. A poor choice of step size can dramatically inflate the error of value estimates and slow convergence. Consequently, in practice, researchers must use trial and error in order to identify a suitable step size -- a process that can be tedious and time consuming. As an alternative, we propose implicit TD algorithms that reformulate TD updates into fixed-point equations. These updates are more stable and less sensitive to step size without sacrificing computational efficiency. Moreover, our theoretical analysis establishes asymptotic convergence guarantees and finite-time error bounds. Our results demonstrate their robustness and practicality for modern RL tasks, establishing implicit TD as a versatile tool for policy evaluation and value approximation.</p></details>|

In this paradigm, $N$ identical agents operate in $N$ replicas of an environment simulator, accelerating data collection by a factor of $N$. A critical question arises: \textit{Does specializing the policies of the parallel agents hold the key to surpass the $N$ factor acceleration?} In this paper, we introduce a novel learning framework that maximizes the entropy of collected data in a parallel setting. Our approach carefully balances the entropy of individual agents with inter-agent diversity, effectively minimizing redundancies. The latter idea is implemented with a centralized policy gradient method, which shows promise when evaluated empirically against systems of identical agents, as well as synergy with batch RL techniques that can exploit data diversity. Finally, we provide an original concentration analysis that shows faster rates for specialized parallel sampling distributions, which supports our methodology and may be of independent interest.</p></details>|

By enabling intelligent control and optimization of household energy consumption, HEMS plays a significant role in bridging the gap between consumer needs and energy utility objectives. However, much of the existing literature construes consumer comfort as a mere deviation from the standard appliance settings. Such deviations are typically incorporated into optimization objectives via static weighting factors. These factors often overlook the dynamic nature of consumer behaviors and preferences. Addressing this oversight, our paper introduces a multi-mode Deep Reinforcement Learning-based HEMS (DRL-HEMS) framework, meticulously designed to optimize based on dynamic, consumer-defined preferences. Our primary goal is to augment consumer involvement in Demand Response (DR) programs by embedding dynamic multi-mode preferences tailored to individual appliances. In this study, we leverage a model-free, single-agent DRL algorithm to deliver a HEMS framework that is not only dynamic but also user-friendly. To validate its efficacy, we employed real-world data at 15-minute intervals, including metrics such as electricity price, ambient temperature, and appliances' power consumption. Our results show that the model performs exceptionally well in optimizing energy consumption within different preference modes. Furthermore, when compared to traditional algorithms based on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), our model achieves nearly optimal performance while outperforming in computational efficiency.</p></details>|

In contrast, humans are able to learn efficiently by watching others interact with their environment. To bridge this gap, we introduce semantic action flow as a core intermediate representation capturing the essential spatio-temporal manipulator-object interactions, invariant to superficial visual differences. We present ViSA-Flow, a framework that learns this representation self-supervised from unlabeled large-scale video data. First, a generative model is pre-trained on semantic action flows automatically extracted from large-scale human-object interaction video data, learning a robust prior over manipulation structure. Second, this prior is efficiently adapted to a target robot by fine-tuning on a small set of robot demonstrations processed through the same semantic abstraction pipeline. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on the CALVIN benchmark and real-world tasks that ViSA-Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in low-data regimes, outperforming prior methods by effectively transferring knowledge from human video observation to robotic execution.

These efforts are informed by scientific reports, which rely in part on Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), prominent tools used to assess the economic impacts of climate policies. However, traditional IAMs optimize policies based on a single objective, limiting their ability to capture the trade-offs among economic growth, temperature goals, and climate justice. As a result, policy recommendations have been criticized for perpetuating inequalities, fueling disagreements during policy negotiations. We introduce Justice, the first framework integrating IAM with Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MOMARL). By incorporating multiple objectives, Justice generates policy recommendations that shed light on equity while balancing climate and economic goals. Further, using multiple agents can provide a realistic representation of the interactions among the diverse policy actors. We identify equitable Pareto-optimal policies using our framework, which facilitates deliberative decision-making by presenting policymakers with the inherent trade-offs in climate and economic policy.</p></details>|

Existing correct-by-construction synthesis algorithms, however, suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Deep learning approaches have been proposed in recent years to address this challenge. In this paper, we contribute to this line of work by proposing an algorithm for training control barrier functions from offline datasets. Our algorithm trains the filter to not only prevent the system from reaching unsafe states but also out-of-distribution ones, at which the filter would be unreliable. It is inspired by Conservative Q-learning, an offline reinforcement learning algorithm. We call its outputs Conservative Control Barrier Functions (CCBFs). Our empirical results demonstrate that CCBFs outperform existing methods in maintaining safety and out-of-distribution avoidance while minimally affecting task performance.</p></details>|

SmallPlan is resource-efficient, making it well-suited for edge-device deployment and advancing practical autonomous robotics.</p></details>|

These measurements thereby allow us to refine predictions from global MHD models. In this paper, we discuss our recent study of the morphological evolution of a CME-driven shock event that occurred on August 3, 2012. Our analysis used white-light coronagraphic observations from three different vantage points in space (SOHO and STEREO A and B). Obtaining data from these spacecraft, we derived key parameters such as the radius of curvature of the driving flux rope, the shock speed, and the standoff distance from the CMEs' leading edge. A notable feature of this event was the availability of rare Faraday rotation measurements of a group of extragalactic radio sources occulted by the solar corona, which were obtained a few hours before the eruption. These observations from the VLA radio interferometer provide independent information on the integrated product of the line-of-sight magnetic field component and electron density. By modeling the shock standoff distance and using constraints from the Faraday rotation measurements, we achieve a high level of agreement between the fast-mode Mach number predicted by the Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere (MAS) code in its thermodynamic mode and the value deduced from the analysis of the 3D reconstruction of coronagraphic data, provided that appropriate correction factors (f_b = 2.4 and f_n = 0.5) are applied in advance to scale the simulated magnetic field and electron density, respectively. Our results are consistent with previous estimates and provide critical information for fine-tuning future MHD simulations.</p></details>|

We describe the observational configuration, outline the calibration of the data, and discuss the effect of Radio Frequency Interference on different observing epochs. In addition, we present a novel radio continuum imaging strategy, using well known baseline subtraction techniques in radio spectral data, and discuss the applications to the removal of artifacts from sources far from the field center. Additionally, we discuss the nature of a low-level image-wide offset, the so-called ``negative bowl" and simulate our observations in order that we may both properly understand and correct for this artifact. Using these techniques, we present the first total intensity image of the data which achieves an r.m.s. noise of 1.3 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ with a synthesized beam of 4.5\arcsec x 4.0\arcsec, the most sensitive L-band image ever taken at this resolution. We then place this image into the broader context of 1.4 GHz radio continuum surveys in the literature, in terms of image sensitivity and fidelity, and $\mu$ Jy level source counts and P(D) analysis.</p></details>|

However, a significant challenge arises from the limitations of visual encoding, which can result in failures during tasks such as object grasping. Moreover, these models typically suffer from high computational overhead due to their large sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. While these models excel in reasoning and task planning, the substantial computational overhead they incur makes them impractical for real-time robotic environments, where speed and efficiency are paramount. To address the limitations of existing VLA models, we propose NORA, a 3B-parameter model designed to reduce computational overhead while maintaining strong task performance. NORA adopts the Qwen-2.5-VL-3B multimodal model as its backbone, leveraging its superior visual-semantic understanding to enhance visual reasoning and action grounding. Additionally, our \model{} is trained on 970k real-world robot demonstrations and equipped with the FAST+ tokenizer for efficient action sequence generation. Experimental results demonstrate that NORA outperforms existing large-scale VLA models, achieving better task performance with significantly reduced computational overhead, making it a more practical solution for real-time robotic autonomy.</p></details>|

This implies a significant increase in visibility data volumes, scaling as $\mathcal{O}(Q^{2}B)$ for $Q$ antennas and $B$ short-time integration intervals (or batches), calling for efficient data dimensionality reduction techniques. This paper proposes a new approach to data compression during acquisition, coined modulated rank-one projection (MROP). MROP compresses the $Q\times Q$ batchwise covariance matrix into a smaller number $P$ of random rank-one projections and compresses across time by trading $B$ for a smaller number $M$ of random modulations of the ROP measurement vectors. Firstly, we introduce a dual perspective on the MROP acquisition, which can either be understood as random beamforming, or as a post-correlation compression. Secondly, we analyse the noise statistics of MROPs and demonstrate that the random projections induce a uniform noise level across measurements independently of the visibility-weighting scheme used. Thirdly, we propose a detailed analysis of the memory and computational cost requirements across the data acquisition and image reconstruction stages, with comparison to state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction approaches. Finally, the MROP model is validated in simulation for monochromatic intensity imaging, with comparison to the classical and baseline-dependent averaging (BDA) models, and using the uSARA optimisation algorithm for image formation. An extensive experimental setup is considered, with ground-truth images containing diffuse and faint emission and spanning a wide variety of dynamic ranges, and for a range of $uv$ -coverages corresponding to VLA and MeerKAT observation.</p></details>|

While vision-language-action (VLA) models have demonstrated impressive results for end-to-end robot control, it remains an open question how far such models can generalize in the wild. We describe $\pi_{0.5}$, a new model based on $\pi_{0}$ that uses co-training on heterogeneous tasks to enable broad generalization. $\pi_{0.5}$ \ uses data from multiple robots, high-level semantic prediction, web data, and other sources to enable broadly generalizable real-world robotic manipulation. Our system uses a combination of co-training and hybrid multi-modal examples that combine image observations, language commands, object detections, semantic subtask prediction, and low-level actions. Our experiments show that this kind of knowledge transfer is essential for effective generalization, and we demonstrate for the first time that an end-to-end learning-enabled robotic system can perform long-horizon and dexterous manipulation skills, such as cleaning a kitchen or bedroom, in entirely new homes.</p></details>|

Rodriguez et.al.|[2504.15519](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15519)|null|<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using JWST near-infrared data of the inner Orion Nebula, \citet{Pearson_McCaughrean_2023} detected 40 binary systems they proposed to be Jupiter-Mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs) -- although their actual nature is still in debate. Only one of the objects, JuMBO\,24, was detected in the radio continuum. Here, we report on new radio continuum (10 GHz) Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) detections of the radio counterpart to JuMBO\,24, and on an unsuccessful search for 5 GHz continuum emission with the High Sensitivity Array (HSA). From our new VLA detections and adopting a distance to the region, we set an upper limit of $\simeq 6$~km~s$^{-1}$ to the velocity of the radio source in the plane of the sky. This upper limit favors an origin for this source similar to that of stars, that is, from a stationary contracting core. The nature of the radio emission remains uncertain but the lack of strong variability (all VLA observations are consistent with a steady flux of $\sim$50 $\mu$ Jy), of detection on long HSA baseline, and of detectable circular polarization in VLA data do not favor a non-thermal origin.</p></details>|

We use observations from Juno's MicroWave Radiometer (MWR), the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to probe for the first time the depth and impact of weather on Jupiter. We use ammonia, the main source of opacity at radio wavelengths on Jupiter, as the tracer for the weather by fitting ammonia anomalies to the MWR brightness temperature variations. We show that the majority of the weather on Jupiter is confined to regions where the clouds are forming. Both the South Equatorial Belt and the Equatorial Zone have surprisingly shallow weather systems (P < 2 bar), and even in the North Equatorial Belt most of the ammonia variations is above the water condensation level (P ~ 6 bar). This confirms that the water condensation layer plays a crucial role in controlling the dynamics and the weather on Jupiter. However, the shallow nature of the weather cannot explain the deep-seated depletion down to 30 bar that the Juno mission has revealed. We do find three features, however, that extend below the water condensation layer: a vortex in the northern hemisphere reaching down to 30 bar, an ammonia plume down to 20-30 bars, and the signature of precipitation down to 20 bar. This work highlights the interplay of large-scale processes (vortices, plumes) and small-scale processes (storms) are responsible for shaping the atmospheric makeup of Jupiter.</p></details>|

The images of NGC6822 reveal filaments, edge-brightened bubbles, diffuse emission, and a plethora of point sources. By contrast, most of the MIR emission in WLM is point-like, with a small amount of extended emission. Compared to solar metallicity galaxies, the ratio of 7.7 $\mu$m intensity ($I_\nu^{F770W}$), tracing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), to 21 $\mu$m intensity ($I_\nu^{F2100W}$), tracing small, warm dust grain emission, is suppressed in these low-metallicity dwarfs. Using ALMA CO(2-1) observations, we find that detected CO intensity versus $I_\nu^{F770W}$ at ~2 pc resolution in dwarfs follows a similar relationship to that at solar metallicity and lower resolution, while the CO versus $I_\nu^{F2100W}$ relationship in dwarfs lies significantly below that derived from solar metallicity galaxies at lower resolution, suggesting more pronounced destruction of CO molecules at low metallicity. Finally, adding in Local Group L-Band Survey VLA 21 cm HI observations, we find that $I_\nu^{F2100W}$ and $I_\nu^{F770W}$ vs. total gas ratios are suppressed in NGC6822 and WLM compared to solar metallicity galaxies. In agreement with dust models, the level of suppression appears to be at least partly accounted for by the reduced galaxy-averaged dust-to-gas and PAH-to-dust mass ratios in the dwarfs. Remaining differences are likely due to spatial variations in dust model parameters, which should be an exciting direction for future work in local dwarf galaxies.</p></details>|

Studies of LMXBs with luminosities up to roughly 20% of the Eddington limit indicate that these outflows generally do not co-occur, suggesting that disk winds might inhibit jets. However, previous observations of LMXBs accreting near or above the Eddington limit show that jets and winds can potentially coexist. To investigate this phenomenon, we carried out a comprehensive multi-wavelength campaign (using VLA, Chandra/HETG, and NICER) on the near-Eddington neutron-star Z source LMXB GX 13+1. NICER and Chandra/HETG observations tracked GX 13+1 across the entire Z-track during high Eddington rates, detecting substantial resonance absorption features originating from the accretion disk wind in all X-ray spectra, which implies a persistent wind presence. Simultaneous VLA observations captured a variable radio jet, with radio emission notably strong during all flaring branch observations-contrary to typical behavior in Z-sources-and weaker when the source was on the normal branch. Interestingly, no clear correlation was found between the radio emission and the wind features. Analysis of VLA radio light curves and simultaneous Chandra/HETG spectra demonstrates that an ionized disk wind and jet outflow can indeed coexist in GX 13+1, suggesting that their launching mechanisms are not necessarily linked in this system.</p></details>|

A capable household robot should recognize ambiguity and ask relevant clarification questions to infer the user intent accurately, leading to more effective task execution. To study this problem, we introduce the Ask-to-Act task, where an embodied agent must fetch a specific object instance given an ambiguous instruction in a home environment. The agent must strategically ask minimal, yet relevant, clarification questions to resolve ambiguity while navigating under partial observability. To solve this problem, we propose a novel approach that fine-tunes multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as vision-language-action (VLA) policies using online reinforcement learning (RL) with LLM-generated rewards. Our method eliminates the need for large-scale human demonstrations or manually engineered rewards for training such agents. We benchmark against strong zero-shot baselines, including GPT-4o, and supervised fine-tuned MLLMs, on our task. Our results demonstrate that our RL-finetuned MLLM outperforms all baselines by a significant margin ( $19.1$-$40.3\%$ ), generalizing well to novel scenes and tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of adapting MLLMs as VLA agents that can act and ask for help using LLM-generated rewards with online RL.</p></details>|

Such problems are of major importance in engineering and sciences as it appears in control theory, fluid and gas dynamics, financial modelling and so on. Solutions of such problems exhibit boundary and/or interior layers, which make them difficult to handle. It has been validated in the literature that standard PINNs have low accuracy and can't handle such problems efficiently. Recently Cao et. al \cite{cao2023physics} proposed a new parameter asymptotic PINNs (PA-PINNs) to solve one-parameter singularly perturbed convection-dominated problems. It was observed that PA-PINNs works better than standard PINNs and gPINNs in terms of accuracy, convergence and stability. In this article, for the first time robustness of PA-PINNs will be validated for solving two-parameter SPPs.</p></details>|

However, existing BSDE-based solvers have empirically been shown to underperform relative to PINNs in the literature. In this paper, we identify the root cause of this performance gap as a discretization bias introduced by the standard Euler-Maruyama (EM) integration scheme applied to short-horizon self-consistency BSDE losses, which shifts the optimization landscape off target. We find that this bias cannot be satisfactorily addressed through finer step sizes or longer self-consistency horizons. To properly handle this issue, we propose a Stratonovich-based BSDE formulation, which we implement with stochastic Heun integration. We show that our proposed approach completely eliminates the bias issues faced by EM integration. Furthermore, our empirical results show that our Heun-based BSDE method consistently outperforms EM-based variants and achieves competitive results with PINNs across multiple high-dimensional benchmarks. Our findings highlight the critical role of integration schemes in BSDE-based PDE solvers, an algorithmic detail that has received little attention thus far in the literature.</p></details>|

Unlike existing deep learning methods for NAH, which are predominantly supervised by large datasets, our approach does not require a training phase and it is physics-informed. The wave propagation field is discretized into sparse regions, a process referred to as field discretization, which includes a series of set of source planes, to address the inverse problem. Our method employs the discretized Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral as the wave propagation model. By incorporating virtual planes, additional constraints are enforced near the actual sound source, improving the reconstruction process. Optimization is carried out using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), where physics-based constraints are integrated into the loss functions to account for both direct (from equivalent source plane to hologram plane) and additional (from virtual planes to hologram plane) wave propagation paths. Additionally, sparsity is enforced on the velocity of the equivalent sources. Our comprehensive validation across various rectangular and violin top plates, covering a wide range of vibrational modes, demonstrates that PINN-SFD consistently outperforms the conventional Compressive-Equivalent Source Method (C-ESM), particularly in terms of reconstruction accuracy for complex vibrational patterns. Significantly, this method demonstrates reduced sensitivity to regularization parameters compared to C-ESM.</p></details>|

The fundamental challenge in CGH is solving the inverse problem of phase retrieval from intensity measurements. Physics-inspired neural networks (PINNs), especially Gerchberg-Saxton-based PINNs (GS-PINNs), have advanced phase retrieval capabilities. However, their performance strongly depends on forward models (FMs) and their hyperparameters (FMHs), limiting generalization, complicating benchmarking, and hindering hardware optimization. We present a systematic sensitivity analysis framework based on Saltelli's extension of Sobol's method to quantify FMH impacts on GS-PINN performance. Our analysis demonstrates that SLM pixel-resolution is the primary factor affecting neural network sensitivity, followed by pixel-pitch, propagation distance, and wavelength. Free space propagation forward models demonstrate superior neural network performance compared to Fourier holography, providing enhanced parameterization and generalization. We introduce a composite evaluation metric combining performance consistency, generalization capability, and hyperparameter perturbation resilience, establishing a unified benchmarking standard across CGH configurations. Our research connects physics-inspired deep learning theory with practical CGH implementations through concrete guidelines for forward model selection, neural network architecture, and performance evaluation. Our contributions advance the development of robust, interpretable, and generalizable neural networks for diverse holographic applications, supporting evidence-based decisions in CGH research and implementation.</p></details>|

Despite being demonstrated the ability to incorporate the physics of laws for versatile applications, PINNs still struggle with the challenging problems which are stiff to be solved and/or have high-frequency components in the solutions, resulting in accuracy and convergence issues. It may not only increase computational costs, but also lead to accuracy loss or solution divergence. In this study, an alternative approach is proposed to mitigate the above-mentioned problems. Inspired by the multi-grid method in CFD community, the underlying idea of the current approach is to efficiently remove different frequency errors via training with different levels of training samples, resulting in a simpler way to improve the training accuracy without spending time in fine-tuning of neural network structures, loss weights as well as hyperparameters. To demonstrate the efficacy of current approach, we first investigate canonical 1D ODE with high-frequency component and 2D convection-diffusion equation with V-cycle training strategy. Finally, the current method is employed for the classical benchmark problem of steady Lid-driven cavity flows at different Reynolds numbers, to investigate the applicability and efficacy for the problem involved multiple modes of high and low frequency. By virtue of various training sequence modes, improvement through predictions lead to 30% to 60% accuracy improvement. We also investigate the synergies between current method and transfer learning techniques for more challenging problems (i.e., higher Re). From the present results, it also revealed that the current framework can produce good predictions even for the case of Re=5000, demonstrating the ability to solve complex high-frequency PDEs.</p></details>|

In axisymmetric tokamak reactors in particular, and under the assumption of toroidal symmetry, this equilibrium can be mathematically modelled using the Grad-Shafranov Equation (GSE). Recent works have demonstrated the potential of using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to model the GSE. Existing studies did not examine realistic scenarios in which a single network generalizes to a variety of boundary conditions. Addressing that limitation, we evaluate a PINN architecture that incorporates boundary points as network inputs. Additionally, we compare PINN model accuracy and inference speeds with a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) model. Finding the PINN model to be the most performant, and accurate in our setting, we use the network verification tool Marabou to perform a range of verification tasks. Although we find some discrepancies between evaluations of the networks natively in PyTorch, compared to via Marabou, we are able to demonstrate useful and practical verification workflows. Our study is the first investigation of verification of such networks.</p></details>|

The estimation accuracy and variation can differ significantly across parameters. For instance, inductance estimations are generally more accurate and stable than inductor resistance in a buck converter. However, these performance differences remain to be analyzed with a more systematic approach otherwise the condition monitoring results can be unreliable. Therefore, this paper analyzes the training loss landscape against multiple parameters of a buck converter to provide a systematic explanation of different performances. If the training loss is high and smooth, the estimated circuit parameter typically is accurate and has low variation. Furthermore, a novel physics-informed neural network (PINN) is proposed, offering faster convergence and lower computation requirements compared to an existing PINN method. The proposed method is validated through simulations, where the loss landscape identifies the unreliable parameter estimations, and the PINN can estimate the remaining parameters.</p></details>|

This work introduces an open-source implementation of the Physics-Informed Neural Network with Control (PINC) framework, designed to model the dynamics of an underwater vehicle. Using initial states, control actions, and time inputs, PINC extends PINNs to enable physically consistent transitions beyond the training domain. Various PINC configurations are tested, including differing loss functions, gradient-weighting schemes, and hyperparameters. Validation on a simulated underwater vehicle demonstrates more accurate long-horizon predictions compared to a non-physics-informed baseline</p></details>|

Traditional methods typically require extensive stress-strain or full-field measurements, which are often difficult to obtain in practical settings. To overcome these challenges, we propose a physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based framework that enables the discovery of constitutive models using only sparse measurement data - such as displacement and reaction force - that can be acquired from a single material test. By integrating PINNs with finite element discretization, the framework reconstructs full-field displacement and identifies the underlying strain energy density from predefined candidates, while ensuring consistency with physical laws. A two-stage training process is employed: the Adam optimizer jointly updates neural network parameters and model coefficients to obtain an initial solution, followed by L-BFGS refinement and sparse regression with l_p regularization to extract a parsimonious constitutive model. Validation on benchmark hyperelastic models demonstrates that the proposed method can accurately recover constitutive laws and displacement fields, even when the input data are limited and noisy. These findings highlight the applicability of the proposed framework to experimental scenarios where measurement data are both scarce and noisy.</p></details>|

Although, efficient quantification of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in big multi-scale problems remains challenging. We propose \$PINN a novel method of computing global uncertainty in PDEs using a Bayesian framework, by combining local Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks (BPINN) with domain decomposition. The solution continuity across subdomains is obtained by imposing the flux continuity across the interface of neighboring subdomains. To demonstrate the effectiveness of \$PINN, we conduct a series of computational experiments on PDEs in 1D and 2D spatial domains. Although we have adopted conservative PINNs (cPINNs), the method can be seamlessly extended to other domain decomposition techniques. The results infer that the proposed method recovers the global uncertainty by computing the local uncertainty exactly more efficiently as the uncertainty in each subdomain can be computed concurrently. The robustness of \$ PINN is verified by adding uncorrelated random noise to the training data up to 15% and testing for different domain sizes.</p></details>|
